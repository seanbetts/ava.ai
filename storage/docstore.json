The Tomb\u200b1. Want to hear a ghost story? That\u2019s good. I know a few.\u200bHow about the one of the sightless blue face, pressed against the cellar window? Orthe apparition of the blind man holding a cane made of children\u2019s bones? What about theevil swan that followed me home through the lonely, rain-washed park, or the giantdisembodied mouth seen opening in the centre of a concrete floor? What of the milk jugthat poured blood; or the empty bath from which choking gurgles sounded after dark?What of the orphan\u2019s spinning bed, or the skeleton in the chimney; or the vile spectralpig, all bristles and yellow tusks, glimpsed snuffling through the dirty glass of a shower-room door?Take your pick. I experienced them all. They represent a typical month\u2019s work forLockwood & Co. during that final desperate summer. Most of them were written up inour casebook by George the mornings after the events concerned, in between sips ofscalding tea. He did this in his boxer shorts, incidentally, sitting cross-legged on the floorof our living room, a sight which was frankly more disturbing than all the hauntingscombined.Our Black Casebook has since been copied and filed away in the National Archives inthe new Anthony Lockwood gallery. The good news about that is you don\u2019t have tonegotiate all the crushed crisps in the pages of the original if you want to know the detailsof each job. The bad news? Not all of our cases are in there. There\u2019s one that was simplytoo terrible to be written down at all.You know how it ended. Everyone does. The city was full of it already on that lastcruel morning, with the rubble of Fittes House still steaming and the remains of my dearones not yet cold. But the beginning? No. That\u2019s not yet public knowledge. For thehidden story of murder, conspiracy, betrayal \u2013 yes, and ghosts \u2013 you need the account ofone who survived it. For that, you have to come to me.My name is Lucy Joan Carlyle. I talk with the living and the dead, and it sometimesgets so\u2019s I can\u2019t tell the difference any more. Here it is, then: the beginning of the end. Here\u2019s me, two months ago. I\u2019m dressed inblack jacket, skirt and leggings, with heavy-duty boots suitable for staving in coffin-lidsand scrambling out of graves. My rapier\u2019s at my belt, a holster of flares and salt-bombs isslung across my chest. There\u2019s a spectral handprint on my jacket and my bob\u2019s croppedshorter than before, because a ghost had recently grasped at it, turning the hair-tips white.Otherwise, I look the same as ever. Kitted out, ready for action. Doing what I do.In the outside world, the stars were out. The day\u2019s warmth was folded up and done. Itwas shortly after midnight \u2013 the time when spirits wandered and all sensible folk weretucked up safe in bed.Me? Not so much. I was shuffling round a mausoleum with my bottom in the air.In my defence it has to be said that I wasn\u2019t the only one doing this. Elsewhere in thesmall stone-clad chamber, Lockwood, George and Holly were also on hands and knees.We had our heads low, our noses near the flagstones. We swept our candles close to wallsand floor. Occasionally we stopped to press fingertips into suspicious nooks and crannies;otherwise we worked in silence. We were looking for the entrance to a grave.  \u201cDo you lot have to bend over like that?\u201d a voice asked. \u201cIt\u2019s making my eyes water.\u201dA thin, red-haired young man was sitting above us on a granite block in the centre ofthe room.

His name was Quill Kipps. He was readying our tomb-cracking equipment,laying out crowbars and coils of rope on the surface of the stone. He was also keepingwatch, blinking through his goggles at the shadows all around.  \u201cSee anything, Quill?\u201d That was Lockwood, dark hair hanging over his face. Hepicked with his penknife at a gap between the flagstones.Kipps lit an oil lamp, tilting the shutters so the light stayed low. \u201cWith you in thatposition, I\u2019ve seen plenty. Particularly when Cubbins hoves into view. It\u2019s like watching abeluga swimming by.\u201d  \u201cI meant ghosts.\u201d\u201cNo ghosts yet. Apart from our tame one.\u201d He tapped a large glass jar perchedalongside him on the block. Green light flared evilly in the jar, and a spectral face ofunusual hideousness materialised, moving closer through a vortex of ectoplasm.\u201cTame?\u201d A disembodied voice that only I could hear spoke in indignation. \u201cTame?!Let me out of here and I\u2019ll show that scrawny idiot how tame I am!\u201d  I sat back on my heels, brushing my fringe out of my eyes. \u201cBest not call the skulltame, Kipps,\u201d I said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like it.\u201dThe face in the jar bared teeth like a dog\u2019s. \u201cToo right. Tell that boggle-eyed fool,Lucy, that if I was out of this prison I\u2019d suck the flesh off his bones and dance a hornpipewith his empty skin. You just tell him that.\u201d\u201cIs it offended?\u201d Kipps asked me. \u201cI can see that horrid mouth moving.\u201d\u201cTell him!\u201dI hesitated. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I said. \u201cHe\u2019s fine, really. He\u2019s cool with it.\u201d\u201cWhat? No, I\u2019m not! And where\u2019 s he get off tapping my glass like I\u2019m some kind ofgoldfish? I swear, when I get free of this, I\u2019m going to catch Kipps and pull off his\u2014\u201d\u201cLockwood,\u201d I said, tuning out the ghost, \u201care you sure there\u2019s a trapdoor in here? Wehaven\u2019t got much time.\u201dAnthony Lockwood straightened; he was kneeling in the centre of the floor, one handholding his penknife, the other running distractedly through his hair. As usual, he wasimpeccably dressed. He had a dark jersey on instead of his long coat, and soft-soledpumps instead of his normal shoes; these were his only concessions to the demands ofbreaking and entering a national monument.\u201cYou\u2019re right, Luce.\u201d Lockwood\u2019s pale, slim face was as relaxed as ever, but his browhad an elegant kink in it that told me he was concerned. \u201cIt\u2019s been ages, and there\u2019s stillno sniff of it. What do you reckon, George?\u201dWith a scuffling, George Cubbins levered himself up into view from behind thegranite block.

Noticeable too that even the thought of that silver coffin gave me a hollowprickling in my gut. I got the same feeling whenever I glanced at the shelf at the far endof the chamber and looked what was sitting there.It was an iron bust of a woman in late middle age. She had an imperious and austereexpression, with hair swept back above a tall forehead. The nose was sharp and aquiline,the mouth thin, the eyes astute. It was not a pleasant face, exactly, but strong and hardand watchful, and we all knew it very well indeed. It was the same face as the one on ourpostage stamps and on the covers of our agency manuals, a face that had shadowed us allfrom early childhood and entered all our dreams.Many remarkable things had been said about Marissa Fittes, the first and greatestpsychic investigator of us all.

It was a compact, high-ceilinged chamber, roughly oval in shape, built of stoneand swathed in shadow. Apart from the big sarcophagus-sized block of granite in thecentre of the room (which had the single word \u2018FITTES\u2019 carved into the top), the placewas empty. There were no windows, and the iron doors that led to the street were closedand tight.Somewhere beyond these doors stood two sentries. They were only kids, but they hadpistols and might have shot us had they heard us, so we had to go carefully. On the upsidethe place was clean and dry and smelt of fresh lavender, and there weren\u2019t any obviousbody parts lying underfoot, which instantly made it preferable to most of the other placeswe\u2019d been that week.But equally, there didn\u2019t seem to be anywhere for a trapdoor to hide.Our lanterns flickered.

Now she got to her feet and joined us, light and silent as a cat. Like the rest ofus, she was in stealth mode: she had her long dark hair clipped back in a ponytail, andwore a zip-up top, skirt and leggings. I could go on about how well the all-black get-upsuited her, but why bother? With Holly, that was a given. If she\u2019d gone around wearingnothing but a dustbin suspended from her shoulders by a pair of spotty braces, she\u2019d havesomehow made it look svelte.\u201cI think we need a fresh perspective,\u201d she said. \u201cLucy, can\u2019t the skull help at all?\u201dI shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll try, Hol.

It\u2019 s obviousenough from up here.\u201dI relayed this to the others. Holly and Lockwood acted as one. They vaulted up ontothe block beside Kipps. Lockwood grabbed one of the lanterns and held it out in front ofhim. They both rotated, scanning the floor, faces locked in concentration. The lightwashed slowly over the flagstones like water, spilling up against the base of the walls.\u200b\u201cThis is pitiful,\u201d the skull said. \u201cI saw it straight off, and I don\u2019t have an eyeball tocall my own.

As soon as she said it, I knewthat she was right.\u201cBrilliant, Holly,\u201d Lockwood said. \u201cThat must be it. Tools ready, everyone.\u201dIt was in moments like this that Lockwood and Co. was at its fluent best. Knives werebrought out, and the cement around the smaller stone cut free. We levered it up withcrowbars; Lockwood pulled it aside. Sure enough, a hinged bronze ring lay beneath, setinto the larger stone. While George, Holly and I loosened the edges of this stone,Lockwood and Kipps tied ropes around the ring, testing the knots and double-testingthem, making sure they could take the strain. Lockwood was everywhere at once, softlygiving orders, helping with every task.

On the opposite side, the second rope hung slack. George and I heldthis: it was our job to support the flagstone once it was lifted, and help lower it quietly tothe ground. In the centre, by the ring, Holly knelt ready with the crowbars.The room was still. Up on the wall our lantern light quivered on the iron head ofMarissa Fittes. It was as if she watched us, the eyes glittering with malevolent life.Lockwood grinned round at us.

It\u2019s going to be ropey by definition.\u201d\u200bBut Lockwood was already heading down the stairs. Beyond him, light flickered onthe iron face. Its thin lips smiled as we descended into the dark. \u200b2. Okay, let\u2019s just pause a moment, while we\u2019re still at the top of the stairs. Nothing nasty\u2019sjumped out at us. No traps have been sprung. We\u2019re all alive and well. That makes it agood time to consider just how the five of us (five and a bit, if you include the skull)came to be there at all, descending illegally into the most famous tomb in London.\u200bI don\u2019t mean the mechanics of how we got inside the mausoleum, though that\u2019s astory in itself: the long nights George spent watching the movements of the guards, theweeks Kipps spent shadowing the sergeant with the key; the stealing of the key (this amasterpiece of timing, with Holly distracting the sergeant while Lockwood pinched itfrom his jacket, took a wax impression and returned it, all in thirty seconds flat); finallythe forging of a replica, thanks to an underworld contact of our disreputable friend FloBones. I don\u2019t even mean how we snuck in during the changing of the guards.I mean why we took the risk at all.For the answer to that we have to go back five months, to a walk that Lockwood and Imade through a dark and frozen landscape. This little stroll completely shook up how weoperated, and changed the way we saw ourselves.Why? Because five months before, entirely unexpectedly, Lockwood and I steppedout of our world and arrived in another place. Where was this place? That\u2019s hard to say.Some call it the Other Side; I guess it has other names too, which people in the oldreligions and the ghost cults use. But from what I saw it wasn\u2019t a heaven or a hell; just aworld very similar to our own, only freezing cold and silent and stretched out under ablack sky.

Our experiences had indicated that there wasa strong connection between the activity of spirits \u2013 in particular their keenness to returnto our world \u2013 and the presence of living persons on the Other Side. It seemed that whenthe land of the dead was invaded, the dead became active, and much more likely toinvade the land of the living. This discovery was of vast importance. For more than fiftyyears, the Problem \u2013 the epidemic of ghosts infesting Britain \u2013 had spread and worsened,confounding all attempts to understand or halt it. We held in our hands a clue to thepossible cause, and we itched to spread this news to the world.Only we couldn\u2019t. Because we\u2019d been forbidden to do so.This edict had come from none other than Penelope Fittes herself. She didn\u2019t knowabout Lockwood\u2019s and my strange journey (we had told nobody but our friends) but sheknew something of what we\u2019d discovered at the Rotwell Institute, and she wanted noword of it getting to the ordinary population. It wasn\u2019t a friendly piece of advice either,more a coolly delivered threat. We were under no illusions about what would happen tous if we chose to give up our silence and go our own way.This, by itself, was outrageous enough: the woman at the heart of the fight against theProblem was telling us not to explore its possible cause. But there was something else,something more disturbing still; and for that insight we had the skull in the jar to thank.Long ago, it had spoken with the great Marissa Fittes; now it had seen Penelope, and ithad big news for us. Penelope was Marissa \u2013 they were precisely the same person.However much we might distrust Penelope Fittes herself, it was clearly not easy toestablish the truth of this extraordinary claim. But we could check one thing.We could see whether Marissa was in her grave. The stairs were steep and narrow. We descended slowly, step by careful step. Lockwoodwas at the front, then George, with Holly and me following. Kipps made up the rear. Eachof us held a candle raised at head height, and so our circles of light fused together,making a little radiant worm or caterpillar inching its way into the earth.Behind us, the dim grey cone of lantern light seeping through the trapdoor faded fromview. To our right was a wall of neat stone blocks, shiny and gleaming with damp. To theleft was an open, unknown space, which our candlelight did not penetrate. Lockwoodrisked a brief flick of his torch, revealing a shocking well of black that made us all flinchtowards the right-hand wall. Then, disconcertingly, this wall vanished too, and we weredescending with an abyss of darkness on either side.Your head did weird things in such a place. Your legs shook; you no longer had fullcontrol over your muscles. You kept feeling you were about to lurch aside and plungeinto oblivion. The problem was compounded by the need for high psychic alert, the fearof something rising towards you out of the dark. Every couple of steps we had to stop anduse our Talents, and this straining against the silence made your head spin even more.It didn\u2019t help that the skull in my backpack insisted on doing a running commentary,constantly adding little reminders of the peril we were in.\u201cOoh, this is a nasty bit,\u201d it said. \u201cCareful you don\u2019t suddenly step sideways andplunge horribly to your death.\u201d And: \u201cWhat\u2019 s it like, falling in pitch darkness, I wonder?\u201dOr simply: \u201cCrikey, don\u2019t trip now!\u201d And so on, until I threatened to toss it over the edge.The wall returned, and at that point the steps veered abruptly to the left, going downwith no less steepness.

The sudden psychicoutburst made me scream with fright. I jerked forwards, jabbing my candle flame directlyinto Holly\u2019s neck. She screamed too, and barged into George; George stumbled andkneed Lockwood in the backside. Lockwood, who had just been bending over to inspectthe step below, lost his balance entirely and tumbled down the stairs, falling head overheels, bump, bump, bump. He dropped his rapier, his candle disappeared over the edge.He finished upside-down, long legs waving in the air.Dead silence. Everyone stood frozen, listening for the creak of moving traps, forshifting stone, for the rustling of grave-cloths. Personally all I could hear was the raucouscackling of the skull. Nothing happened. Lockwood got stiffly to his feet. Picking up hisrapier, we cantered down to join him.  \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re so fussed about.\u201d This was the skull, a few moments later.We were clustering round the jar, bog-eyed and livid, while the face grinned out in highdelight. \u201cYou know me,\u201d it said. \u201cI\u2019m excitable.

I moved tothe front of the group, just behind Lockwood, with the ghost peering from my backpack.\u200b\u201cThis is great,\u201d the skull said. \u201cThe best seat in the house. With luck I can watchLockwood trip over his own feet again. So, fill me in.

Our thermometers showeda temperature of seven degrees: chilly, but not exceptional. It gave no cause for concern.That didn\u2019t mean we were putting our rapiers away. Lockwood and I set down ourcandles and switched on our torches. With weapons at the ready, we walked slowlybeneath the arch into a large stone room.\u200bThe burial chamber of Marissa Fittes was a high, domed space, with an oval outlinethat echoed that of the mausoleum far above. Our torch beams crossed and re-crossed it,picking out the same curved walls of closely fitting blocks, the same clean flagged floor.There were no doors, no niches, no alcoves to be seen. But in the middle of the vault\u2014Our beams speared inwards to meet at the central point. This was a raised, rectangularplinth of smooth grey stone, a couple of feet high, with bunches of dried grey lavenderpropped against it. It had the word FITTES inscribed along the side.On top of the plinth, glinting coldly in our torchlight, was a silver coffin.The coffin had been covered with a magnificent silver drape, emblazoned with thefamous Fittes symbol \u2013 a rampant unicorn.\u200b\u201cDon\u2019t want to rush to any conclusions,\u201d Lockwood murmured, \u201cbut I think we mightbe there.\u201d\u200bGeorge too spoke in a whisper; it was not a place for noise. \u201cThat\u2019s the special coffinin which she supposedly lay in state. Three days in Westminster Abbey, with mournersfiling by. Then they brought her here.\u201d\u200b\u201cIf she is here,\u201d I said. I was Listening again. No, it was okay. Everything was still.\u200b\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re here to find out.\u201d Lockwood walked purposefully across the vault.In the briskness of his movements, he was counteracting our unspoken fears. \u201cWon\u2019t takefive minutes, then we\u2019re gone. Do it like we practised. Chains at the ready.\u201d\u200bTime and again, in the peace and comfort of 35 Portland Row, we\u2019d gone through thispart of the operation. We\u2019d known it was the crunch point, when fear might make usforget essential things. So we\u2019d rehearsed on a sofa in our living room, circling it withiron chains, looping their ends carefully, sewing salt and iron filings on the ground,setting up lavender candles at regular distances all the way round. Good protectivemeasures, carried out swiftly and well. In moments we had the plinth surrounded in thismanner, sealing in the coffin \u2013 and whatever it contained.\u200bWe stood ready, just outside the chains.\u200b\u201cAll right,\u201d Lockwood said. \u201cNow for the coffin.

For all that it was socold, all of us were clammy with nerves. Holly\u2019s face had blanched; Kipps looked as if hewas trying to chew off his own bottom lip. Even the skull at my shoulder had gone quiet,the green glow dulled almost to nothing.\u200bLockwood took a deep breath. \u201cOkay, so this is my job.\u201d He looked round at us. \u201cOldMarissa started everything \u2013 the agencies, the fight against the Problem.

If the skull\u2019s story was true, the coffin would be empty.\u200bLockwood took hold of the lid and pushed it upwards.

It tipped upand up and over \u2013 and came to a gentle halt, hanging back at an angle.The interior of the coffin was a slot of thick darkness, black to the brim.Kipps and George lifted their arms. Light from their candles scooped out the slot.Now we could see that the interior was upholstered in red silk\u2014And filled by something. Something long, thin and covered in white linen.For a few seconds, no one spoke. Holly and I had our arms raised, flares cupped inour hands. The others were likewise frozen, rigid, breath rasping between bared teeth. Westared at the shrouded shape. It had an awful kind of gravity that held us all transfixed.\u201cWell, somebody\u2019s at home,\u201d Holly said in a small voice.Kipps swore under his breath. \u201cSo much for that skull\u2019s promises.\u201dThis was a point. I came to life, rapped on the ghost-jar. \u201cSkull!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Faint green light flared sullenly within the glass. \u201cThis had better be good. Ican\u2019t hang around. There\u2019 s too much silver here for me.\u201d\u201cNever mind that! Look in the coffin.\u201dA pause followed. \u201cOh, well. Could be any old corpse in there. Might be a pile ofhalf-bricks wrapped in sacking. I can tell you one thing, it\u2019 s not Marissa. Uncover theface and see.\u201dThe light faded. I told the others what the skull had said. None of us much enjoyedhearing it.\u201cSuppose we had better take a look,\u201d I said.Lockwood nodded slowly. \u201cRight\u2026 Well, it\u2019s easy enough.\u201dThe body of that quiet someone in the coffin was not wrapped tightly, but insteadconcealed by a loose cloth. Whoever pulled back the drape would have to step inside thechains, reach in close to the shrouded thing.\u201cEasy enough\u2026 Lockwood said again. \u201cIt\u2019s just a dead body, like any other, andwe\u2019ve all seen plenty of those.\u201dHe looked at us.\u201cOh, very well,\u201d he sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll do it. Stand ready.\u201dWithout hesitation he stepped over the iron chains, reached into the coffin, took holdof a corner of the cloth and, with a fastidious movement, flicked it away. Then he jumpedback. We all flinched with him. As Lockwood said, we\u2019d seen enough decomposedbodies not to want to be as far away as possible when the dreadful sight was revealed.And it was dreadful. Only not in the way expected.It wasn\u2019t decomposed at all.Long grey hair lay thick and lush across an ivory pillow. It cradled a gaunt white face,the skin flowing like wax beneath our candlelight. It was the face of a woman; an agedwrinkled woman, bony, with a nose curved thin and sharp like the beak of some bird ofprey. The lips were closed tight, the eyes too. It was recognisably the same face as on theiron bust upstairs, only older and frailer. What was awful about it was that it didn\u2019t appearto be long-dead, but only sleeping. It had been miraculously preserved.No one spoke. No one moved. At last a blob of hot wax from his candle dripped onKipps\u2019s hand.

He held up both hishands in confirmation. The tapping noise continued. We stared at one other. Weswallowed our chocolate in unison. Then we looked behind.Something protruding from under the rumpled grave clothes was striking the side ofthe coffin, making the tapping sound. It was a cupped wax hand, twitching and jerking insilent spasms. As we watched, the trembling extended up the arm, and all at once thewhole wax dummy was shaking, as if in protest at the coils of ghost-fog now rising fromthe grave.   \u200b3. Ten minutes earlier, it would all have been fine. Even five minutes earlier would havebeen okay. We were so keyed up when we came into the vault, the first apparition toshow its face would have been impaled by five rapiers simultaneously. As for the coffin,anything jumping out when we opened the lid would have been diced and dismemberedbefore it knew what was happening. But the extreme shock \u2013 and subsequent anticlimax\u2013 of finding the wax mannequin had fatally distracted us. We had allowed ourselves toswitch off. This in turn had lured us into committing the three cardinal sins of psychicinvestigation: we\u2019d stopped using our Talents, we\u2019d stepped beyond the chains, and we\u2019dturned our backs on an open coffin. Even the rawest seven-year-old trainee knows toavoid those mistakes. Rookie errors, every one.\u200bSo it was that when we saw the mannequin moving and the coils of ghost-fog loopingtowards us, we were \u2013 for a crucial moment \u2013 stunned and frozen. It took our brains asplit second longer than normal to react.This delay was enough. We lost control.So thick was the mist, it was as if the coffin were filling up with white liquid. Itpooled around the edge of the body in the shroud, lapping at its contours, swirling andspiralling as if being stirred by unseen hands. And the stiff, yellow figure was infected bythe movement. It juddered into life. Cupped fingers hooked over the lip of the coffin.There was a cracking sound, as of wax breaking. The mannequin thrust itself upwardsinto a sitting position.\u201cBack! Back!\u201d\u200bIt was Lockwood\u2019s cry. As one, we threw ourselves off the platform, away from thecoffin. But panic breeds panic; mistakes escalate. Lockwood was fine: he was alreadytwisting as he jumped, whipping a flare from his belt. He landed on bent knees, the otherside of our iron chains, his right arm pulled back and ready to throw. The rest of us? Wedidn\u2019t possess such finesse. We were just tumbling every which way, crashing down onhands and knees. I knocked over a candle, arched like a cat to avoid the ring of chains,then rolled unglamorously through a mess of salt and iron. Holly and George fared evenworse. Both careered straight into the circle, twisting the links violently out of position.Looped ends came away from each other; the circle was broken.A cold wind blew outwards through the gaps and across the vault.I finished my roll in a crouch, and spun on my heels, grappling for a flare.

I stood motionless, myflare still unused in my hand. Up until this point my psychic Senses had been numbedwith shock.

The mannequin wasn\u2019t far away now; and it was certainlygetting faster, its joints entirely free of their wax surround. You could see nubs of boneworking at the hips and ankles.

What\u2019s your name?\u201dI waited, giving it time to adjust. The dummy was in a pretty bad way. In places thewax surface glistened where it had been partially melted by the fire. Thin droplets randown the torso, striping it, leaving it pitted and gouged. One side of the head had beenstaved in, either by the fall from the coffin or by the flares. You could see a jawboneinside the hole, a few teeth imbedded in the wax. Basically, it was a mess. And the ghostinside would be no better off, maddened by its physical prison and by its unknownresentments. I reached out to it, offering what I could, which was pity and understanding.\u201cWe can help you\u2026\u201d I said again.The broken thing shuffled nearer.

A faint figure was hovering above the stairs a few feet further on. It hadthe faint form of an old woman. She had a knee-length skirt, a shirt and jacket, long greyhair, and an unpleasantly smiling face. Everything about her was grey, except for herblack and glittering eyes.Lockwood shook his head. \u201cA little old lady? Terrifying. You\u2019ve got rapiers, haven\u2019tyou?

The ghost\u2019s haircame to sudden life, flaring out about its head: cold air swept down the steps, pitchingLockwood sideways; he scrabbled desperately, and just avoided careering off the edgeinto the shaft.

I gripped my torchbetween my teeth. Launching myself close, I clambered up the stones and peered inside.There was a tiny cavity, lined with beaten silver.

In our swirl ofdesperate torchlight, the Visitor was revealed as a mess of jangling bones, held togetherby strings of plasm.

Instead, it remained standing. Aghostly head, faint and cobwebby, was superimposed where the skull had been.

La Belle Dame Sans Merci\u200b4. Thirty-five Portland Row, the home and headquarters of Lockwood & Co., was a veryspecial place. Whenever the old black front door shut behind me, and I saw thewelcoming glint of the Aztec crystal skull-lantern on the key table, the weight of theworld was lifted from me like a conjurer snapping a cloak up into the air. I\u2019d toss myrapier into the umbrella stand, hang my jacket on the peg, and walk up the hall past theshelves with their odd collection of pots and masks and painted gourds. If it was daytimeI\u2019d peep into the living room to see if anyone was resting or working there; by night I\u2019dcheck the library, which was where we tended to crash after a case. If all was quiet, I\u2019dstroll past the staircase to the kitchen, where the lingering smells of toast (Lockwood) orteacake (George and Kipps) gave clues to who might be home. Occasionally, if the tin ofdried green tea had been opened, or one or two sunflower seeds lay scattered on theworktop, I knew Holly was around and probably working in the office. You couldn\u2019talways tell, though; she was the tidiest of us, and rarely left such clues. Most rare of all,an odour of stale kippers and traces of dried river-mud kicked off by the back-door gavecertain proof that Flo Bones had recently called by.\u200bThe house was our sanctuary, a refuge from ghosts and other, darker things. And thehappiest times of all were the breakfasts we enjoyed after a case, with the blinds open onthe garden, and the sunlight streaming in.On such an occasion, the morning after our visit to the Fittes Mausoleum, Lockwood,George and I were sitting at the kitchen table. Holly had gone out to Arif\u2019s stores to fetchfurther supplies; the surface of the table was littered with open jam jars, egg cups, butterdishes and toast crumbs, but we were all still hungry. At one end of the table, the ghost-jar was striped by sunlight coming through the blinds. We all had mugs of tea. George,who had eaten well, was sat in his chair with a hideous wooden mask propped in his lap.He was using a damp tea towel to wipe the dust from it. Lockwood had a pen and wasdoodling on a corner of the Thinking Cloth, while simultaneously glancing at anewspaper leaned against the ghost-jar. In the jar itself the ghost was dormant; the plasmstirred lazily in the late morning sun, like green water in a deep and weedy pool.I sat quietly next to Lockwood, enjoying the companionable silence. My musclesached, my head was clothy. Lockwood had a scrape to the left temple, and the lenses ofGeorge\u2019s spectacles were soft with grave-dust. Our exertions hung heavy on us. But wehad not yet spoken of the night before.\u200b\u201cLots of news this morning,\u201d Lockwood said, indicating the paper.I opened an eye. \u201cGood?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cBad?\u201d\u201cBaddish and bad.

George was wise in such matters: a doughnut was a goodcorrective and almost made the world seem right again. Almost, but not entirely. Becausethe world wasn\u2019t right. And Holly\u2019s little encounter wasn\u2019t an unusual one at all. Traditionally, the activities of all psychic detection agencies were overseen by theDepartment of Psychical Research and Control, or DEPRAC, which operated out ofScotland Yard in central London. DEPRAC had the power to punish misbehaviour andensure high professional standards. Sometimes fines were levied and, in rare cases,companies shut down. But generally the department concentrated more on researchingthe Problem than bothering agents in the field.Since Penelope Fittes had taken command of the Rotwell agency, however, things hadbegun to change. Ms Fittes now controlled three-quarters of all agency activity inLondon, and she had at once set about bringing the rest to heel. Fittes personnel began tooccupy many senior posts at Scotland Yard. New rules came into force. Henceforth,independent detection agencies, with their limited resources, had to confine their effortsto small-scale hauntings. Not only that, they had to submit to regular DEPRACinspections to ensure they were acting professionally. Any firm in breach of these ruleswould be immediately closed down.As the smallest agency of all, Lockwood & Co. found itself the centre of officialattention. We were stopped in the street and asked to show papers to prove what jobs wewere on. And we were followed too, as we went about our work. There weren\u2019t spiesstanding outside our doorway all the time. Instead, we were forever looking over ourshoulders and finding nothing \u2013 until, one day, with grim inevitability, there would be asmirking boy trailing us to Marylebone Tube, or a man in a trilby standing outside Arif\u2019sStores, brazenly watching as we trooped by.

The representatives wouldask to look at our casebook, take copies of our recent invoices, ghost-records, and clientreviews and, after accepting tea and biscuits, and a boatload of Lockwood\u2019s tousledcharm, head on their way.Once they\u2019d gone, we\u2019d shut the door, lock it, and get on with the things we werereally doing. Outwardly, we kept up a fa\u00e7ade of ordinary, small-scale cases. Beyond that,we had an agenda of our own. This double life had its challenges, and each of mycolleagues coped with it in their own way.Holly Munro met it as she did all obstacles, with brisk efficiency that looked aproblem in the eye and didn\u2019t blink. Whether it was breaking into the Fittes mausoleum,or standing up to interrogation in the street, she always maintained her trademark Munrocool. It was hard to imagine her ever losing this quality, and somehow that made meconfident, despite everything, that nothing really dreadful could or would happen in thisworld. Her unflappable demeanour used to make me seethe, yet now I found it a sourceof reassurance. Come what may, I knew Holly\u2019s hair would swish like gossamer as shewalked; her clothes would flow effortlessly round her curves; her skin would glow withthat same coffee-coloured lustre that spoke of close association with mineral water andgreen-bean salads, and contrasted, reprovingly, with my famous burger-and-biscuitcomplexion. No, Holly would always be the same, and that made me happy.George\u2019s steeliness was of a different sort. To strangers, it might have seemed that hehad none. He was too soft, too scruffy, too dishevelled. If he\u2019d ever knowingly shared aroom with a hairbrush, there was precious little sign of it. His doughy, featureless facelacked signposts to a personality, let alone a strong opinion. Even those enemies whoknew his fame as a researcher saw this quality as something negative. They thought him apassive absorber of information, a shuffler of papers; someone better wedged safely in astudy chair than facing supernatural terrors in the field.\u200bIn this, as in everything, they were entirely wrong. George\u2019s researching prowess, hisability to tramp from library to library, spending endless dusty hours hunting for thesmallest clue, was based on ferocious determination and an iron will. If he hunted forsomething, he found it; if he found something he clung on like a terrier and shook it untilall the relevant facts fell out. He was remorseless. He took the epidemic of ghosts as apersonal affront, and the more pressure the Fittes Agency exerted to stop us investigatingit, the deeper George dug in. He would not be denied.\u200bAnd then there was Lockwood. Lockwood, most of all.He was the centre around which we revolved \u2013 all of us, even Kipps, who acted as anassociate, rarely coming to Portland Row itself; even Flo Bones, the terror of the tide-line, one of the most outstanding relic-women of the city, at least in terms of smell.Mostly unnoticed among the ghost-filled streets of London, Kipps and Flo both wentabout quiet errands on our behalf \u2013 and they did so because Lockwood asked them to,and that was enough.The secret to his pull, and of his resilience in the face of the Fittes Agency\u2019s spyingand intimidation, was his combination of enormous energy and otherworldly calm. Fewthings fazed him; he remained coolly detached, absorbing pressure with a tilted eyebrowand a small, wry smile, before translating it into swift, sure action.

The elder of the two was a short, stoutperson in a startling yellow-checked jacket, not overly new, with leather patches on theelbows. He wore a grey waistcoat, pushed out to bursting by his protuberant belly, and achecked white shirt, behind the open V of which grey-white chest-hairs played andspilled like summer brambles. His cord trousers were a vigorous deep red. His face wasalso red; it suggested too close an acquaintance with the wine bottle. He had animpressive crop of very curly grey hair, wedged beneath a worn green felt hat; a snubnose; a wide, elastic mouth, and a pair of small, bright eyes that seldom stopped movingand never properly met your gaze.\u200bBeside him was a thin youth of scrawny, malnourished appearance. He wore old jeansand a baggy jersey that emphasised rather than concealed his lack of width. His nose waslarge and rather hooked, and beneath a shock of unruly black hair, his skin had analarming bone-white pallor. His face was utterly expressionless.

Smashing!\u201d\u200b\u201cWell, we were kind of hoping to share it out between us,\u201d George said.\u200bLockwood raised his hand. \u201cBefore we deal with cake or curse,\u201d he said, \u201cthere\u2019s onething we need to discuss\u2026\u201d He paused significantly, hoping the visitor would get thehint. \u201cWell,\u201d he said finally, \u201cwe can\u2019t help noticing the chain...\u201d\u200bMr Tufnell gave a little start as of mild surprise; a weak and liquid smile sloshedacross his face. \u201cWhat, this chain here? This chain? Oh, that\u2019 s just for Charley Budd\u2019sown safety. Don\u2019t go worrying on your own account.\u201dLockwood frowned. \u201cI\u2019m not. But\u2014\u201d\u201cHe won\u2019t hurt you, not poor Charley.\u201d With his free hand, Mr Tufnell ruffled thelad\u2019s hair. \u201cOnly, he isn\u2019t so particular about himself, if you take my meaning. See thatcake knife there? If I weren\u2019t vigilant, he\u2019d be on it in a trice. Bury it in his own heart, hewould, and spoil your lovely carpet.\u201d\u200bWe looked at the carpet, and then at the cake knife, and then at the boy, who satquietly in a world of his own.\u200b\u201cHe\u2019d stab himself?\u201d I said.\u201cAssuredly.\u201d\u200bHolly had perched herself on the arm of George\u2019s chair. She said, \u201cSurely, Mr Tufnell,if he\u2019s\u2026 if he\u2019s ill, he should be in hospital. He needs doctors who\u2014\u201d\u200b\u201cDoctors can\u2019t help him, Miss.\u201d Lew Tufnell shook his grey head sadly. \u201cDoctors?Medics? Pah! I\u2019d like to see them try. They\u2019d drug him and truss him up and what haveyou, and all the while his life would drain away regardless, till in a day or two he was justanother corpse what\u2019s spirit\u2019s gone a-roving. Waste of time, doctors. No, Miss. We needyou. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here.\u201d\u200bThere was a silence.

Been in the family a hundred years. My old dad now, FrankTufnell, he used to take it up and down the country, but what with the Problem, travel\u2019snot so easy now.

Not willowy and pliantlike this young lady here.\u201d He flashed his broken teeth at Holly.\u201cLucy and I can both handle ourselves very well,\u201d Holly said.\u201cSo,\u201d Lockwood said, \u201cit was a close shave for Charley. And now we get to poor RoyMorrison.\u201dThe impresario\u2019s shoulders dropped; he studied his hands. \u201cRoy was our magician\u2019sapprentice. Late yesterday afternoon he was on-stage, setting up equipment for today\u2019sshow. One of our girls, name of Tracey, was down in the auditorium, sweeping the floor.All at once she felt cold. She looked up and saw that Roy wasn\u2019t alone. There was awoman with him. The woman was sort of facing Tracey, but she couldn\u2019t make her out; itwas like she stood in shadow, even though the lights of the theatre were on. As shewatched, the woman glided back into the dark of the wings. She didn\u2019t walk or turn, butjust sort of flowed backwards, Tracey said, and Roy walked after her. Not running, butnot hesitating neither. He disappeared between the side curtains.\u201d\u201cDid Tracey call out or try to stop him?\u201d I asked.\u201cShe says she wanted to speak, but for some reason couldn\u2019t. As soon as Roy wasgone, she found she could move again; she ran to the steps at the side of the stage andheaded between the curtains. It ain\u2019t pretty, this next bit.\u201d\u201cOh, do get on,\u201d Holly said. \u201cDo you know how many ghosts we\u2019ve dealt with?Please.\u201dMr Tufnell accepted the reprimand without complaint. His voice was soft, his earlierebullience gone. \u201cTracey went into the wings, and there she saw the woman and Royagain. It was like they were embracing: at least, the woman had thin arms around him,and her face was in his neck. The horrible thing is that Roy\u2019s a big lad, but it was like hewas all limp and boneless, and the woman was holding him up. And sure enough whenshe let go \u2013 her arms didn\u2019t loosen, but sort of passed in through Roy\u2019s body and werewithdrawn that way \u2013 he just collapsed to the floor all shapeless like a pile of dirty rags.He was quite dead, and when Tracey turned him over he had a terrible smile on his white,cold face.\u201dLockwood tapped his fingers on his knee. \u201cWhat about the ghost woman?\u201d\u201cVanished before poor Roy hit the floor.\u201d\u200b\u201cYou\u2019ve been slow coming to us. Too slow. When Charley had his narrow escape\u2014\u201d\u200b\u200b\u201cI know.\u201d Mr Tufnell inspected his hands like they had somehow disappointed him. \u201cIknow.

It was a place where the representatives ofDEPRAC, checking on our activities in the basement office, never thought to go. Whichwas lucky for us, because it contained a dark and terrible wonderland, filled with thingsthat threatened one\u2019s health and sanity, and I\u2019m not just talking about George\u2019s bedroom.There was another room there that had once belonged to Lockwood\u2019s sister, Jessica \u2013 theroom she\u2019d died in. Here her death-glow hovered perpetually above the stripped-backbed, and stacks of crates lined the walls, each stamped with faded export permits fromforeign lands. And set out on the one clear area of floor, surrounded by a circle of ironchains, were selected items from those crates: items strange, dangerous and forbidden.  There were masks, fashioned in the shape of wild animals and monstrous spirits.There were cloaks, one covered in feathers, one in moulting fur. There were peculiarconstructions of bone and feather and strings of animal gut, threaded with multicolourediron beads, that Lockwood said were Javanese ghost-catchers. And there were pots,sealed with lead and wax. These in particular we treated with extreme caution. It was inthe breaking of one of these that Jessica Lockwood had lost her life eight years before.\u200bIt was quite a haul. The tweedy, placard-waving ghost-cultists, who paraded throughTrafalgar Square most days, would have fallen on their knees before the items on display.Fittes researchers would have sold their grandmothers to have seen them. Rich collectorswould have fought each other for them tooth and nail, while relic-men would have cutour throats and pinched them while we slept. Inspector Barnes of DEPRAC would simplyhave arrested us and confiscated the lot. So it was that we took care to ensure that thecollection remained secret, known by nobody except us, Kipps and Flo.\u200bWe stood at the door, looking in.

Not only did they travel there \u2013but they had shipped back many items of interest in giant packing crates. Some of thismaterial had ended up on the walls of 35 Portland Row, but much remained in boxes,having arrived in Britain after their unexpected deaths. We had only begun to investigatethese recently, and had at once unearthed two marvellous feathered cloaks, or spirit-capes, that had been worn by Indonesian shamans while conversing with their ancestors.Lockwood and I had discovered that the protective properties of these capes were notmere legend: they had shielded us when we walked the icy paths of the Other Side.Without them, we would certainly have died.\u200bOne of the capes was lost; the other remained with us, locked in the storeroom in ouroffice basement, next to our supplies of coke and beans and crisps.

If they\u2019re kept inside the chainsthey should be safe enough.\u201d\u201cWell, don\u2019t sneeze near them,\u201d George said. \u201cThat\u2019s my advice. It\u2019s a mini-clusterwe\u2019ve got right there. Imagine if they all got out.\u201d\u200b\u201cYes, imagine\u2026\u201d Lockwood\u2019s glance lingered on the death-glow hovering above thebed. Then he turned the light off and closed the door. We didn\u2019t have any jobs scheduled in that evening. This was a good thing, as we neededto get ready for the Belle Dame case the next day. Through the afternoon I restocked ourbelts; Lockwood rang Mullet\u2019s, and ordered more rapiers and chains. Then he and Hollydid paperwork for recent cases. George was off at the Archives and didn\u2019t return. Atteatime I fixed a hurried meal, re-heating one of George\u2019s old stews from the freezer. Weate it in the basement office. Holly went home. George was still out. It was justLockwood and me at Portland Row.\u200bI was tidying up in the kitchen when Lockwood peered round the door.\u201cI was just nipping out, Lucy. I wondered if you\u2019d like to come along.\u201d\u201cOn a case?\u201d\u201cOf a kind.\u201d\u201cYou want to go now?\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re not doing anything important.\u201dI so wasn\u2019t.

Your rapier should be fine.\u201dSo it wasn\u2019t a tough ghost, then.

Away to our right burned the dull lights of the Euston Road. Below us,silence and shadow held sway. It was an old-style inner city graveyard, where space hadbeen at a premium. The headstones were set almost on top of each other, and were largelysubmerged beneath a thicket of brambles, with the tallest urns and angels cresting thefoliage like boats on a turbulent green sea. Fingers of ivy clung to the inside of theboundary wall. Here and there, old yews emerged like melting candles, joined to thethicket below by strings of ivy and trailing vines. The ground was choked. The cemeteryhad evidently been abandoned for some time.It looked a melancholy patch of ground, not particularly threatening. Equally, it wasnot an easy place to swing a sword. \u201cWhat kind of Visitor is it?\u201d I asked.A cool wind was coming along between the houses, and Lockwood\u2019s coat fluttered athis back as we stood together on the wall.

One of the last rays of sunlight wasshining on them. They were made of grey stone: modern, sharp-edged and unsullied bywind or rain. Neither was ornate, but the one on the left was larger. It was crowned by acarving of a beautiful, sad-faced woman in a hooded cape. On the plinth below, in strongclear letters, was written:Celia LockwoodDonald LockwoodKnowledge sets us free The second stone was just a simple slab, inscribed with two words only:Jessica Lockwood \u201cOh, Lockwood,\u201d I said.He stood beside me in the dark, face almost lost behind the raised collar of his coat. \u201cIsometimes wonder what it\u2019s all about,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy we do what we do.

Sure enough, I\u2019d almost tripped on a black metal rod, no higher thanankle height, that ran through the grass at my feet. I knew what it was: a boundary rail,used in cemeteries to mark the edge of a plot. I hadn\u2019t noticed it before, but now I sawthat the Lockwood headstones were set in their own railed-off family plot. And I noticedtoo that while the parents\u2019 stone was set in the centre of this space, and Jessica\u2019s stonewas to the right, there was an empty area on the left-hand side.I looked at this bare patch of grass. And when I did so everything faded out \u2013 thebeating of my heart, the whisperings of the wind as it worked its way through the holesand hollows of the ivy, the sound of distant night-cabs on the Euston Road.I gazed at it. At the unobtrusive patch of ground, at the empty, waiting grave.It took me a moment to realise Lockwood was still talking. \u201cThey\u2019d already shut thecemetery when my sister died,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was some controversy about putting herhere. But when there are family plots, where it\u2019s the clear intention that people should beburied together, it\u2019s considered correct to honour the wishes of the dead.\u201dHe didn\u2019t need to say why. Keep the dead happy. Don\u2019t give them a reason to comeback.I stepped over the rail, crossed the grass and sat on the stone beside him.\u201cIt\u2019s nice, don\u2019t you think,\u201d Lockwood said, \u201ckeeping the family together? Anyway,\u201dhe added, after a pause, \u201cI come here sometimes.\u201dI nodded. I was looking at the stamped, sliced foliage, chopped and broken andsavagely hacked back. \u201cThanks for bringing me here,\u201d I said.\u201cThat\u2019s all right.\u201dWe sat in silence for a time. At last I was emboldened. \u201cYou never told me how ithappened.\u201d\u200b\u201cMy parents?\u201d He paused so very long that I thought he was refusing to talk of it, ashe had so often before. But a strange relaxation had laid itself upon him in that place.When he spoke, his voice was soft; it carried no barbs or warning signs. \u201cFunnilyenough,\u201d he said, \u201cit wasn\u2019t far from here.\u201d\u200b\u201cWhat?

There.\u201d\u200bI stared at him. \u201cYou never told me.\u201d The underpass was a short, ugly, concrete tunnelwhere the Euston Road ducked underground to avoid intersecting with another importantstreet. Night-cabs drove us through it all the time, Lockwood and me. He\u2019d never givenme the slightest inkling. \u201cSo it was a car accident?\u201d I said.\u200bHe drew one knee up, clasped it with his hands. \u201cQuite a spectacular one.

In the same way that the graveyard was choked with thewinding weeds and brambles, my head felt full now, choked with Lockwood\u2019s memories.It was no different from the sensations I got when I picked up psychic feedback throughthe power of Touch. They didn\u2019t feel like second-hand emotions. It was like I\u2019d beenthere, like I\u2019d lived them myself.

He was looking towards the family plotagain, and at that little patch of empty ground.\u200bLockwood shrugged. \u201cWell, it\u2019s all so random, isn\u2019t it? Everything about the Problemis so stupid and arbitrary. That Charley Budd we saw today. Why was he snared, and notsomeone else? Why wasn\u2019t Tufnell taken? Why did my sister die and not me? There\u2019s nomeaning to any of it. We can\u2019t choose the manner of our passing, can we? All we can dois try to make it count. Come on. If you\u2019re ready, we should go.\u201d\u200bHe took a few paces across the clearing. I didn\u2019t follow him. I stood between him andthe headstones, arms on hips, seeking to block them out.\u201cBut there is meaning, Lockwood,\u201d I said, raising my voice. \u201cWe just have to find it.If Marissa\u2019s at the heart of all this, we need to expose her \u2013 make her pay. There areanswers, Lockwood. We know there are. We just need to keep on searching.\u201dHe turned back to me.

Informative as these mightbe they weren\u2019t revealing in the same way as actual words spoken by a spirit. Buttraditionally such words were often impossible to fathom. The famous refrain of the DireMaid, a spectral waif carrying a butcher\u2019s knife that had haunted Covent Garden marketin the early years of the Fittes agency, was fairly typical.

They wereechoes of memory, rather than evidence of active intelligence. But Marissa, the mostfamous Listener of all, had also encountered certain Visitors that truly communicatedwith her, by which she meant full conversations. She classed these entities as \u2018TypeThree\u2019 spirits, and since her death (real or faked), no one else had come across them.\u200bNo one except for me.In recent months I\u2019d experienced a gradual unfurling of my Talent, a slow, sureflowering in dark places.

We turned our attention to the business of the day.We had agreed to arrive at Mr Tufnell\u2019s establishment at 5 o\u2019clock that evening, whenthere was still an hour or two of daylight left, and we could properly look over the PalaceTheatre and the surrounding fair.

It showed the same blonde woman in another chilly-looking pose, this time with the words \u2018The Hangman\u2019s Daughter\u2019 written alongside. The\u2018D\u2019 was formed of an ominous-looking noose.\u200bLockwood angled the handbill round approvingly. \u201cAha, so you found out somethingmore about our glamorous ghost, La Belle Dame?\u201d\u201cHer real name would do for a start,\u201d I said.\u201cWe\u2019ve got it here.\u201d Lockwood pointed to a corner of the handbill. \u201cSee? \u2018Featuringour sinister star, Marianne de Sevres.\u2019 Classy. She must\u2019ve come straight from Paris.\u201d\u201cOr possibly Luton,\u201d George scratched his ear. \u201cTurns out Marianne de Sevres wasonly her stage name. Her real name was Doris Blower. She\u2019s first heard of at an end-of-the-pier show in Eastbourne a hundred years ago. Within five years she\u2019s packing outaudiences at the Palace Theatre in Stratford. Tufnell was right: she was a big star of herday, and it was all based on a certain kind of act \u2013 one that combined glamour, sensationand the threat of violent death.\u201d He glanced round at us. \u201cThat pretty much summed upher off-stage life too.\u201d\u200b\u201cMr Tufnell said she was a cruel and wicked woman,\u201d Holly said, \u201cwho wrapped menround her little finger. Or that was the implication.\u201d\u200b\u201cIt\u2019s pretty much accurate,\u201d George said. \u201cThe popular papers of the day were full ofstories about the rich married men who\u2019d fallen for her, and all the wives she\u2019d wronged.At least one attacked her in the street. She never stayed with anyone long, but discardedthem like sweet wrappers. It\u2019s rumoured that more than one man killed himself for loveof her. When she heard about it, La Belle Dame laughed and said it was life imitating art.All her shows involved that kind of story too.\u201d\u200b\u201cCharming woman,\u201d I said.  \u201cAnd now a charming ghost.\u201d George consulted his notes. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not surprisingshe\u2019s shown up at the Palace Theatre, because that was her base for years. She performedmany illusions there, all of which were set up as little dramas or playlets. Each one endedwith a staged death that was acted out with the utmost precision. The one she actuallydied in, \u2018The Sultan\u2019s Revenge\u2019, was a story about a faithless queen who did all sorts ofnaughty things behind her husband\u2019s back. When he found out, he had her sealed up in amassive coffin and run through with fifty swords.\u201d George pushed his glasses up hisnose. \u201cGuess that\u2019s entertainment for you.\u201dHolly gave a snort of disgust. \u201cWhat a foul story. Who\u2019d want to see that?\u201d\u201cLots of people. It was the sensation of the age. Another of her hits was the \u2018CaptiveMermaid\u2019. They built a great glass tank on stage, and filled it with water. La Belle Damewent splashing about with a fish tail; she played an innocent mermaid who was caught bya jealous rival and horribly mistreated. At the end she was tied to lots of weights and\u2014\u201d\u201cPardoned, I hope,\u201d Holly said tartly.\u201cI\u2019m going to guess \u2018thrown into the tank to drown\u2019,\u201d I said.\u201cPoints go to Lucy there,\u201d George said. \u201cYes, it was a famous illusion.

Not half.\u201d\u200b\u201cBesides, there\u2019s no mystery about the two victims so far,\u201d Lockwood went on. \u201cBothCharley Budd and Roy Morrison displayed classic patterns of psychic vulnerability.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d George said. \u201cDidn\u2019t you notice? According to Tufnell, the kid whodied was totally lovelorn, practically starving himself through romantic misery. If adustbin in a dress had rolled past him, he\u2019d have gone scampering after it. As for CharleyBudd, he was sickly and in some pain. It may be he subconsciously wanted release: that\u2019swhy he followed the ghost. In other words neither of the victims was physically ormentally strong.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d Holly said. \u201cYou mean the ghost could sense their weaknesses?\u201dGeorge nodded. \u201cExactly. We all know Visitors sense anger and sorrow. They\u2019reattracted to people who give off strong emotions. Perhaps they\u2019re also drawn to weaknessand despair. These two were enfeebled in different ways\u2026 in one way or another theyboth had weak connections to life. Both were clearly vulnerable to some cut-pricesupernatural glamour.\u201d\u201cWhich we aren\u2019t,\u201d Lockwood added. \u201cEnd of story. George and I will be fine. Won\u2019twe, George?\u201d\u200bGeorge nodded. \u201cYep, we\u2019re cold-eyed professionals. Can I have that handbill back,Lucy? I want to stick it in my casebook as a fold-out spread. Thanks, that\u2019s fine.\u201d\u200bWith that the meeting broke up. Lockwood went off to Mullet\u2019s; George didpaperwork. Holly and I practised with our rapiers until we were hot and thirsty and thestraw dummies hanging in the practise room were full of holes. Motes of straw floated inthe air.

To get to the Palace Theatre, Stratford, in the east end of London, required taking theunderground trains, which ran until almost nightfall. Shortly before four, George, Hollyand I put on our work-belts and snapped our rapiers into position. We locked up PortlandRow and walked to Baker Street station, carrying our bags of iron. The ghost-jar, sealedand silent, was in my backpack. Lockwood was still at Mullet\u2019s, and would travelseparately. We would meet him at the theatre door.It had been a pleasant early autumn day, heavy with warmth that piggybacked on sixweeks of hard, hot weather. The streets were still busy, but with that faint electric chargethat always builds up as dusk approaches. The people moved ever more quickly, theirfaces set, intent on getting their jobs done.

She preferred living under starsand bridges, with water lapping at her wellingtons, in an isolated and amphibiouslife.\u200bThere was a moment of silence, in which it became clear that Flo was focused onGeorge, and that George was watching her expectantly. Holly and I looked from one tothe other and back again.\u200b\u201cWell, so I got it, then,\u201d Flo said.

At a signalfrom the slimmest, they sauntered over. We drew ourselves up. We knew who they were.The leader was a young man with short fair hair and a moustache; he wore a greenishtweed suit, and moved with fluid ease. Even at a distance, the eye was drawn to him;close proximity made for warier fascination, as one might regard a wolverine slinkingnearer through a wood. There was an aggressive jauntiness about him; a certainty ofviolence \u2013 not now, necessarily, but soon. The mark of that hung at his belt. Swords wereforbidden to anyone who was not an accredited operative.

Five minutes before wegot there, we could hear faint hurdy-gurdy music, and smell hotdogs on the wind.\u200bPerhaps, as Mr Tufnell had asserted, his business was doing well. But in the lateafternoon, with the shadows lengthening, it didn\u2019t radiate prosperity. The Palace Theatreitself was a hulking construction, standing by itself on the edge of a stretch of wasteground. At one time it must have been impressive: it had a columned front, reminiscentof a Roman temple, with carved figures above the pillars depicting both tragic and comicscenes. But the concrete in the columns was cracked and broken, with metal cablesshowing through, and half the carvings had gone. The main doors were boarded up. Entryto the building appeared to be from the field alongside, where many tents of fadedcolours, their canvas soughing and snapping in the wind, lay interspersed with flimsywooden towers and structures of obscure purpose. A makeshift iron fence, in whichsnack-food wrappers fluttered like trapped insects, surrounded the compound. A sirenplayed a chintzy melody; this was the cue for closure of the fair. The last few sad-facedpunters, their draggled sticks of candyfloss held out before them like lepers\u2019 bells, wereshuffling homeward through the rusty gates.\u200bLockwood was standing just inside the gates, with Quill Kipps beside him.\u201cIsn\u2019t it fabulous?\u201d Kipps said, as we joined them. \u201cI\u2019ve seen internment camps thatlook jollier than this.\u201d\u200b\u201cDidn\u2019t know you were with us on this one, Quill,\u201d I said.\u201cNor did I.

This, combined with hisnaturally downbeat temperament, meant that a thin vein of resentment still ran throughhim, like a layer of bitter chocolate in one of George\u2019s raspberry cakes. In addition, hehad lost his Talents as he crossed into his early twenties; despite the pair of goggles we\u2019dgiven him, which allowed him to see ghosts, he knew the deprivations of age. Theseexperiences had mellowed, even humbled him.

A number of youths were moving here, sweeping theboards, shifting brightly coloured cubes and baskets around. They worked in silence, butI could hear their hurried breathing. The acoustics were excellent \u2013 even whisperednoises carried to the far end of the auditorium.Tufnell led us up the aisle, our boots pattering on the wooden floor. High above,several long ropes hung down from the dark, some ending in trapeze bars, others tied torings fixed into the balconies. I imagined them in motion, with hurtling bodies intemporary flight. The idea made my palms sweat. It was hard to get over the scale of theplace. Far from giving clarity, the dozens of little lights merged together, flummoxing theeyes. You couldn\u2019t pick out the details of the balconies without squinting. The ceiling waslost in the warm gold haze.We climbed steep steps at the side of the stage, and walked out into the light.\u201cThis is it, Mr Lockwood,\u201d Tufnell said. \u201cThis is where La Belle Dame met her end.\u201dHe waved his arm at the youths, who had stopped work and were watching him. \u201cAllright, you lot can go. Straight outside, no dallying. You know the reason why.\u201dThe stagehands trooped away. We dumped our bags and rucksacks in the centre of thestage. Ranged at the edges were wooden cubes of varying sizes, brightly coloured, withhinged lids and little doors. At the back sat an enormous blue crash-mat, knee-high andvery broad. Otherwise the surface of the stage was bare, marked by tape and scuffs ofdecades.Lockwood was gazing about him, eyes narrowed, face calm. I knew he was using hisSight now, hunting for death-glows or other signs of psychic disturbance. \u201cWhat\u2019s thecrash mat for?\u201d he asked. \u201cAnd these boxes? Part of the show?\u201dTufnell nodded. \u201cWe start with the trapeze act. They do their thing, then swoop downon the mat. The boxes are for the magic show. The props are in there; you know, cageddoves, metal hoops, that stuff. Lots of hidden cubbyholes. Our stage manager designedthem. She\u2019s very good. But you\u2019ll be wanting to see where Roy died? It\u2019s stage left, in thewings.\u201d\u201cThank you,\u201d Lockwood said. \u201cWe\u2019ll start there.\u201dThey moved away towards the curtains. I remained in the centre of the stage. Once,long ago, the sultan\u2019s casket had sat here, pierced by swords, blood pouring out onto theboards. I looked at my feet, at the bland, smooth wood. I looked out into the golden dusk,imagining the packed house, the stunned silence, the first appalling screams\u2026No time like the present. I crouched, put my fingertips to the floor. I closed my eyesand Listened\u2026As if I\u2019d opened a sealed door, I was at once surrounded by a strange and paperyrustling, an expectant murmur. It was the sound of an audience making itself comfortablein a thousand seats. The noise rose and fell like the breathing of a giant. I waited, but itdid not change.I stood slowly. The noise was still there. And somewhere underneath it, muffled as iffrom far away, I could make out Tufnell\u2019s voice, as he spoke to Lockwood in the wings.The two sounds did not collide, but ran through each other, being separated by a centuryof time.I turned slowly towards wings, started walking after the others.

I stepped to the edge of the stage.The murmur in my head grew loud, turned to sudden wild applause. It came from allaround me, starting in the stalls, then rippling in a wave across the balconies and boxes. Ilooked up, scanning the hazy reaches.At once the sound cut out.And now: nothing. It was as if the theatre held its breath.When I looked down again, the shape was no longer sitting in the stalls. But there wasan object in the central aisle, directly opposite where I stood. It stood far back under theshadows of the balcony, squat and rounded, almost like an urn or barrel. Darknessenfolded it. I could see no details.  Except\u2026Something was slowly extending from it along the aisle. A dark, thin line; a thread ofblack. Another followed it, and then another. They slowly unspooled out into the light,trickling down the gentle slope towards the stage.I gripped my sword. The threads glistened and shone darkly under the gold lights.They linked and separated, lacing the ground. Longer and longer they grew; faster andfaster they came. There was no end to them. I found myself frozen on the lip of the stage.I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off the rivulets of blood that ran towards me between the stalls.      \u200b9. \u201cShe\u2019s here!\u201d My shout echoed out across the hall. \u201cLockwood! She\u2019s here!\u201dWith that, I leaped from the stage, out over the pooling blood, my sword flashingunder the lights. I landed on a seat in the front row, crashing heavily, almost falling; thenI was up and jumping from back rest to back rest, arms outstretched to keep my balance,chair-hopping my way along the rows. There was no way I was going to touch the floor.On the aisle to my side, the lines of dark liquid flowed past like there would be no end tothem. Ahead of me, darkness billowed; I could no longer see the object in the aisle, butcold beat against my face.From chair to chair, across the empty theatre; to where the seats were swallowed bythe shadow of the balcony overhead.There in the dark! A woman\u2019s form, striding towards me.No time to think, no time to react. With a savage cry, I adjusted my final leap andsprang towards it, rapier aloft and swinging round\u2014\u201cAre you quite mad?\u201d A tall girl came out into the light. She wore jeans, trainers anda bright blue hoodie, and there was a smaller girl behind her. That was about all I took inas I jerked desperately aside, dropping my rapier and landing inelegantly beside them inthe aisle. Which was now entirely empty of blood. Cigarette ends, yes; gum wrappers andcrisps \u2013 in fact all manner of audience leftovers. But the rivulets of red had gone.I stood up slowly, breathing hard. I recognised the second of the girls. It was Tracey,the usherette we\u2019d met at the entrance. I didn\u2019t know her companion. The aisle behindthem was empty as far as the Exit doors. It wasn\u2019t that cold now either.

Same with the actual sultan\u2019s casket, of course.That was destroyed after the original inquest, too.\u201d\u200bWe looked at her. \u201cHow do you know all that?\u201d Holly said.\u200bThe tall girl shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m stage manager. I look back at old techniques, get ideas forscenes and set-pieces. I read it up in books on theatre history.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re a bit of a researcher too?\u201d George adjusted his glasses. \u201cI like your style.\u201d\u200b\u201cAh, she\u2019s a clever girl, Sarah is,\u201d Mr Tufnell said. He was visibly shifting from onefoot to another, eager to be gone. \u201cAnd committed to Tufnell\u2019s, despite our recenttroubles. Though I says it as shouldn\u2019t, she was fond of poor Roy in particular. I\u2019m muchobliged to her for carrying on in such tragic circumstances. Ain\u2019t I, Sarah? But now wereally should go.\u201d\u200b\u201cAll right,\u201d Lockwood said. \u201cIf there\u2019s nothing more\u2014\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not just the stage you need to be looking at,\u201d Sarah Parkins said, as they turned", "start_char_idx": 2831, "end_char_idx": 3971, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f8b617ef-9cb0-43b5-ba56-d4e961d69925": {"__data__": {"id_": "f8b617ef-9cb0-43b5-ba56-d4e961d69925", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "47", "file_name": "Lockwood-V-The-Empty-Grave-First-Draft.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6352d4aa-9bf2-4b25-82a4-8153ff952971", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "47", "file_name": "Lockwood-V-The-Empty-Grave-First-Draft.pdf"}, "hash": "5515fc2574784a226a390ec6f5328a06593c694d7fd0c0c3da6dff64a9109d6f"}, "3": {"node_id": "a4dd7d95-ffd8-4e9a-a24d-17e7e52b7a3d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "47", "file_name": "Lockwood-V-The-Empty-Grave-First-Draft.pdf"}, "hash": "1b81bd7e89195f5f5948e2cd9c4caef8832023cd3bfa2cd0c0958cbd977c804e"}}, "hash": "105e0385e878e3ce86b4631635439c3ae444affbf559be79cee0326bc3d9283a", "text": "to leave. \u201cI can tell you that at least. The thing appears all over. I saw it up in the dressingroom corridor.

Most everywhere. I don\u2019t think anywhere\u2019s safe.\u201d\u200bMr Tufnell and his employees departed into the gathering dusk, leaving the door onto thefield propped open. We were left to ourselves. As we always did in a haunted building,we set off on a careful inspection, and we immediately discovered that the Palace Theatrewas a complex and sprawling structure. It had three distinct areas, interconnected by avariety of stairs, passages and confusingly positioned doors; and each area, as SarahParkins had intimated, gave some cause for psychic concern.At its heart was the auditorium itself, with no less than three levels of seating \u2013 thestalls on the ground floor; the first floor balcony, or lower circle; and the steeply inclinedupper circle, or \u2018gods\u2019 level, up near the roof. The individual theatre boxes near the stagewere reached by passages running at circle and gods levels. We did a number of psychicreadings on every floor, and detected traces of supernatural activity: fleeting chills, subtlemiasmas, a pervading sense of unease that came and went almost at random.The second main area was the \u2018front of house\u2019. This included the entrance foyer onthe ground floor, two sets of main staircases, and two other public spaces directly above,on circle and gods levels, from which the balconies were reached. The stairs were linedwith faded plush carpets, muffling all sounds. One of these seemed colder than the other,for no discernable reason. Next to the foyer on the ground floor was the dark, narrowexhibition space containing \u2018Tufnell\u2019s Marvels\u2019, which turned out to be a collection ofmechanical devices, or automata, that moved and chimed if money was put into them. Wetreated this area with extreme caution, as we\u2019d encountered haunted automata before, butdespite the presence of several mechanical clowns, which so often cause trouble, theroom seemed psychically quiet.The third and final area of the theatre, and one we were particularly interested in, wasthe \u2018backstage\u2019 region, comprising the stage, the wings, the dressing rooms and basementstores. There was a cold spot on the stage, which roughly corresponded to the placewhere I\u2019d heard the sound of the audience from long ago. It was four degrees cooler thanthe rest of the auditorium. Lockwood ordered an iron circle to be set up near to this, andwe equipped it with magnesium flares and salt bombs. We also paid close attention to thedressing room corridor beyond the wings, and to the musty basement beneath the stage,which was filled with racks of costumes, broken scenery and unidentifiable debris. Nofurther cold spots were discovered, but we fixed up circles in both these locations too.\u200bOnce, while walking across the first floor foyer, I thought I heard a peal of far-offlaughter, but other than that the place was utterly still.\u200bAt last Lockwood gathered us into a huddle on the dim-lit stage. Faint glows studdedthe auditorium\u2019s expanse. We\u2019d turned the lights everywhere to their lowest setting. Itwas too big and complex a place to risk wandering completely in the dark.\u200b\u201cWe\u2019ve had a good look round,\u201d he said softly. \u201cAnyone got any thoughts?\u201d\u200b\u201cStill think the stage is the place,\u201d Kipps said.

You never plug Lockwood\u2019 s mouth with a giant cork, orstick a gym shoe in Holly\u2019 s gob to keep her quiet.

And too high off the ground. I shone my torch upand\u2026 And it was a woman hanging there. Hanging by the neck, and spinning slowlyround.

I was over there below the balconies, when I heardan odd little winching sound. I looked round and saw a full-size guillotine, with the bladejust rising. A girl was fixed in the stocks below, crying piteously for help. There was abasket below her, and when the blade fell\u2026\u201d He waved a hand. \u201cAnyway, I\u2019m pretty sureI saw the climax from La Belle Dame\u2019s French Revolution extravaganza, \u2018The FairTricoteuse\u2019. Holly, you had the \u2018Hangman\u2019s Daughter\u2019, while Kipps had the \u2018CaptiveMermaid\u2019. Yep, it looks like La Belle Dame\u2019s giving us her full repertoire.

It\u2019s all just an act \u2013or not even that: it\u2019s the echo of an act. The ghost\u2019s messing with our minds. The problemis \u2013 she\u2019s covering a wide area. Where\u2019s she going to crop up next?\u201dI glanced behind me at the dark expanse of seats, then back at Lockwood. \u201cHave youseen anything?\u201d\u200b\u201cNo.\u201d\u200b\u201cYou\u2019re the only one who hasn\u2019t.\u201dHe shrugged. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m just resistant to these things. Right, if everyone\u2019s happy,we stick with the plan. It\u2019s clear that she\u2019s got the run of the whole theatre. We\u2019ll keepmaking wide sweeps of it. Her Visitations so far have been fleeting. Sooner or later, she\u2019llhang around long enough for us to react. Then we\u2019ll deal with her. Any questions?\u201dNo one had any. Chocolate was shared, and drinks taken. We began our rounds again. Hours passed and bled into each other; outside was darkness, inside, the theatre\u2019s softgold glow. The ghost appeared to have exhausted its resources with its three concurrentvisions. Even the sporadic phenomena of the early evening had petered out to nothing. Ibegan to think we\u2019d exhausted the activity for the night, and grew a little bored.At an unknown point the skull and I found ourselves (for the second or third time) inthe room of automata, known as Tufnell\u2019 s Marvels. It was a dark, winding corridor, withbrightly coloured mechanical toys arrayed in glass cases on either side. Some weresimple figures \u2013 hinged bears and clowns and grotesque policemen that could move ordance; others were complex little scenes showing real life tragedies, such as The GreatFire of London, that would come to brief, cog-driven life if you put your money in.First thing I did, as always, was check the temperature and use my Senses.

I took the backpack off and set it on the floor, with the skull\u2019s jarpeeping out. Then I took the pound from my pocket and sent it clinking into the slot.\u200bAt once, a light came on inside the caravan, illuminating a hideous witch-likesilhouette, all pointy nose and chin. There was a deranged cackling. With rhythmic jerks,the side of the caravan swung back. Lights disguised as candles hung from the ceiling;these sprang into flickering life, revealing a badly painted crone hunched over a table, acrystal ball clutched between gnarled hands. As I watched, a milky brightness flared inthe ball. The cackling came again. The hands moved across the surface of the crystal. Amechanical cat chased a mechanical mouse around the back of the fortune teller, and amechanical crow on her window-sill cawed loudly. The candles flickered; cupboard doorsopened and closed, revealing concealed skulls and demons. The light in the ball flaredand went out. A tinny bell rang somewhere, and something rattled into the hatch at thefront of the cabinet. Cogs whirred and spun. The caravan began to close.\u200bI put my fingers in to the hatch. Whether it was a glitch or not, two pieces of paperhad emerged instead of one. I took them out and read them in the light coming from thefortune-teller\u2019s window.\u200bThe first read:\u200bHe will go into the dark.The second:\u200bHe will sacrifice his life for you.I stared at the papers for a moment, then crumpled them abruptly in my hand.

It was a stupid machine.\u201cWhat did it say?\u201d the skull asked. \u201cBet it was something terrible.\u201d\u200b\u201cOh, shut up. Why don\u2019t you ever shut up? You\u2019re always on at me.\u201d\u200bThe skull said nothing. I waited. Nothing. Even in my anger and disquiet this struckme as slightly odd. When I glanced down at the jar, I saw that the ghost\u2019s face was indeedanimated, the bug-eyes rolling, the mouth moving urgently. Yet I heard nothing. Then Inoticed that the lever at the top of the jar had swung closed, blocking the psychic contact.\u200bI hadn\u2019t turned the lever.\u200bA breeze ruffled my skirt against my legs; chill air parted my hair and brushed aroundthe contours of my neck. A soft white glow extended out across the floor, sparkling onthe glass of the cabinets like the light of a cold new dawn. It was a gentle light, and theface of the smiling woman standing close behind me was gentle too. As I turned, I\u2019d beenscrabbling for my sword, but one look at that radiant lady was enough to make merecognise how silly and inappropriate such an action was. I let my fingers hesitate on thehilt; hesitate, then fall away. \u200b  \u200b10. The woman was all fair and shimmery, with a pearlescent wasp-waisted dress that floweddown tight against her legs before spilling out like plunging foam. Her shoulders werebare, her long slim arms as white and sweet as sugar. She did not stand still, but swayedgently side to side \u2013 her arms and body stirring separately, like reed fronds in anunderwater current. Her pale hair fell in waves around her neck, cascading over hershoulders, moving, always moving as if to secret music. And how sweet the face was!

She\u2019s a sack of pus and bones, Luce. That\u2019s below even my paygrade.\u201d\u200bThe woman was gazing at me, the long dark eyelashes beating in time to the rhythmof my heart. Again I felt the tug of longing, again a jarring anger at the vulgarity ofGeorge\u2019s words. I laughed harshly. \u201cWhat rubbish are you talking, George? Pus?\u201d\u200b\u201cWell, okay. The technical term is \u2018clear, translucent ichor, manifested into a semi-solidified corporeal state\u2019.

Outwardly I stared at her just as before. But this time, I was willingmyself to see.Even so it was hard.

It drew back, retreating to the shadows of the passagebeyond, where it hung a moment, fizzing, steaming.

Right, the good news about La Belle Dame is that I don\u2019tthink it likes being up-front aggressive. What it wants is a passive victim. As long as weall stay strong, it\u2019ll keep its distance.

It was solike you.\u201dWell, the thing had been an actress, of a kind. We were out onto the steep steps of thelower balconies now, and the great soft silence of the auditorium closed round us again.Lights glimmered on the balcony railings below, with the trapeze ropes hanging in theshadows and the dim white stage gleaming across the gulf beyond. We spun round,scanning the sloped seats, looking for Lockwood\u2019s reassuring shape. But there wasnothing.\u201cHe could have gone out one of the other exits,\u201d Holly said, pointing. \u201cTakendifferent stairs down. This place is such a maze.\u201dI didn\u2019t answer. I damped down my panic, cleared it from my mind. Holly was right.The theatre was a maze. There was no use just running about hoping to strike lucky.Lockwood could be anywhere. It could be anywhere.Or could it? Though the thing had manifested in many random locations around thebuilding, there was a pattern when it came to its attempts at psychic enchainment. It hadbeen leading me towards the stage. Charley Budd had been rescued walking towards thestage door too. The victim who had thrown himself down from a box \u2013 he\u2019d seeminglywanted to get on stage too.And Roy Morrison, the only one who had actually been on the stage?Much good it had done him.

She was too good an agentto argue, though she must have been desperate to interrogate me, find out my plan.I hardly knew what it was myself.Or rather, my conscious brain didn\u2019t. If it had, I\u2019d have been crawling, coweringunder the nearest seat. But the unconscious bit, that was way ahead. It had made thecalculations. With Holly sent packing, I turned my attention to the railings on thebalcony.Far below, Lockwood was clambering, step by step, up onto the stage. His sword wasat his belt, his hands hung limp beside his coat. If he was fighting the compulsion, therewasn\u2019t any sign of it. How slim he was, how frail he looked from here. Under the lights,the haze of shadow that I knew was still ahead of him was harder than ever to see, but Iwasn\u2019t bothering about it now. I was clambering onto the rail, beside where the trapezeropes hung. There were several of them, ends tied to a jutting metal frame. Each ropelooped out and downwards across the awful space, before extending up towards thedistant roof.I seized the frame, steadying myself, refusing to look down at the stalls far below.The nearest rope looked likeliest: its outward curve was very large. Tufnell hadmentioned the way the trapeze artists started the show, so I knew the leap was possible.That didn\u2019t mean it particularly bore thinking about.Far away, on the hard white stage, Lockwood had reached the centre. Somethingshimmered into existence a short way ahead of him: something in a long white dress withflowing hair. It was radiant and lovely; it cocked its head at him. A slim arm beckoned. Iheard a husky voice, whispered on the air.\u201cCome to me.\u201dAnd Lockwood moved forward.Know what? That made me mad. I picked up the rope with my left hand, pulling ittowards me. It was heavy, rough and fibrous; I gripped it, winding my wrist and arm tightround. Then, with my free hand I slashed at the knot below; the rapier point cut it aseasily as a flower stalk, and I had the rope\u2019s weight pulling on my arm.I leaned back, and gave a small jump upwards. Gravity did the rest.Don\u2019t make me tell you what it was like, looping down through the air. Down beingthe key word of that horrific descent. I was basically falling, leaving my stomachsomewhere in the region of the balcony, and with the stalls below leaping up to receiveme like rows of rabid dogs. Then I was passing over them at ferocious speed, so close Imight have kicked the hats off people sitting there; rushing with my arm nearly pulledfrom its socket and my fingers burning on the rope, and my outstretched sword flashingunder the lights.

Or not exactly headless \u2013 the head was stillfrowning at me from mid-air. It was almost in its correct position, but clearly disjointedfrom the torso. Its long fair strands of hair coiled round it, slapping against the lacy dress,seeking to bind it back to the stump of the neck.Even now, she wasn\u2019t done. The lips twisted in a parody of a smile.\u201cCome\u2026\u201d\u201cYou know,\u201d I said, \u201ca lot of trouble would be avoided if people like you just laydown and accepted they were dead.\u201dI threw a canister of iron, which shattered against the boards; countless filings wentracing beneath the ghost\u2019s feet. The nearest particles ignited, surrounding La Belle Damewith a circle of green flames. The figure leapt and jumped in agitation, knocking the headaside. Coils of hair grappled urgently at the bare white shoulders, and with spiderymovements resumed hoisting the head towards the body.Didn\u2019t bother me. I had plenty of canisters. I chucked another one, setting more plasmalight. The apparition shivered, lost its focus. Its set smile began to fall away.Somewhere far off, a door banged.

It was too selfish, too needy, too vacuous; I didn\u2019t want to share psychic space withit a moment longer, and I was aware of Lockwood\u2019s absence at my side. Besides, Tufnellcould always get himself a new stage. The explosion hit it directly from below: flameswent right through its body, blowing the head like a kettle lid high into the air. Half theplasm was vaporised instantly in the blast; the remainder was frail and faint, the merestoutline, the ghost of a ghost. I watched it as it fled away across the stage, diminishing asit went, the head pulled after it on strings of plasm. As it went, the bright dress dwindled,the white limbs shrivelled up; the open sword wounds in the body glinted like black stars.It dived at one of the big wooden cubes, merged into the wood and vanished.\u201cWhere is it?\u201d Black hair streaming behind her, Holly raced across the burning stage.\u201cWhere is it? Where\u2019s it gone?\u201dI didn\u2019t look at her. \u201cThat yellow box!\u201d I said. \u201cThe Source is there! Find it! Seal itup!\u201d With that, I cast the ghost from my mind. I stood in front of Lockwood, looking upat him. How pale and cold his skin was when I took his hand. His eyes were almostblank; almost, but not quite. I could see his consciousness like a twist of smoke, driftingin the depths.\u201cLockwood!\u201d I slapped him hard across the cheek.Somewhere behind me came a series of violent crashes.

A Body in the Street\u200b11. It was afterwards said that at the very moment that Holly wrapped the silver net aroundthe bloodstained tiara hidden in the box, at that very moment out in Tufnell\u2019s caravan onthe far side of the field, little Charley Budd stopped howling, sat up and asked for chickensoup. So the theatre people knew instantly that we\u2019d done the job, and that the ghost wasgone. Their subsequent emergence into the auditorium, step by cautious step, was nicelytimed, as we were just battling to extinguish the fire I\u2019d started on the stage. All handscame to help. By dawn, the fire was out, the theatre safe, the tiara wrapped ready fordestruction in the Furnaces; and Sarah Parkins, the stage manager who had built thesecret compartment that concealed the Source, and who had promptly admitted to puttingit there, was locked in her trailer under the watchful gaze of two of the burliest trapezeartists, awaiting the arrival of the DEPRAC vans.\u200bFor Mr Tufnell, it was a satisfactory end to the affair, though he groaned to highheaven at the magnesium burns in the centre of the stage. Sarah Parkins\u2019s guilt hadlikewise dumbfounded him. \u201cTo think she should be the cause of all this!\u201d he cried, hisface beetroot with emotion. \u201cSuch betrayal! Such malice! I treated her like a daughter!\u201d\u200b\u201cActually, it wasn\u2019t about you,\u201d Lockwood said. Seeming none the worse for hisrecent psychic enchainment, it had been Lockwood who had identified the culprit andinvited her to confess. He had subsequently spent half an hour talking with her in thecaravan. \u201cSarah\u2019s told me what happened. It was originally about Roy Morrison. Youmentioned yourself, Mr Tufnell, that Sarah had been fond of him, but by your ownaccount he\u2019d fallen head over heels for that Russian trapeze artiste with the thighs. Sarahwas left rejected, and her heartbreak became hatred. She wanted revenge. It so happenedthat in her work clearing out the prop stores, she\u2019d discovered a relic of La Belle Dame\u2019slast performance \u2013 the tiara she\u2019d worn for The Sultan\u2019s Revenge. It had been kept for allthose years in an iron box, which must have suppressed the ghost. Without knowing itspsychic significance, Sarah got it out. Subsequent sightings of the Spectre \u2013 and itsparticular interest in young men \u2013 made her realise its potential. She hid the tiara onstageand awaited developments. It wasn\u2019t long before Charley Budd was snared, but Sarahdidn\u2019t want him dead: that\u2019s why she saved him. Roy Morrison, a day later, wasn\u2019t solucky.\u201d\u200b\u201cHold on,\u201d Holly asked, \u201cwhy didn\u2019t she remove the tiara after his death? Why riskother people\u2019s lives?\u201dLockwood shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say. Even Sarah wasn\u2019t sure. I think herprivate misery had morphed into a dull hatred for the world in general. Or perhaps shefound she simply liked the secret power\u2026 But that\u2019s a matter for Inspector Barnes, notfor us. Here he is now. I\u2019ll fill him in.\u201d\u200bLooking at Lockwood in that moment, as he strode across to meet the DEPRACcontingent, coat flapping behind him, so confident and self-possessed, you\u2019d have beenhard pushed to realise that an hour or two before he\u2019d been a ghost\u2019s plaything.

Kipps and Holly had gone to their respective homes; mid-morning sawGeorge, Lockwood and me all sleeping late and long. When I woke up again, sometimeafter noon, the first thing I saw was the ghost-jar, still protruding from the top of mybackpack where I\u2019d slung it on my bedroom chair. It was tilted at an angle, thanks to afair-sized pile of dirty washing; and the spectral face inside was staring at me like I\u2019d justshot his grandmother.\u200bStrangely, it was a reassuring sight. I flicked the lever, and sat blearily at the end ofthe bed, tousled and comatose, letting the shrill complaints flow over me.\u200b\u201cI didn\u2019t shut you off this time,\u201d I said, when I could finally get a word in. \u201cIt was theghost.\u201d\u200b\u201cSo? It\u2019 s still your fault! You can\u2019t let any old ghost woman go around fingering myjar. It\u2019 s your responsibility to look after it. I can\u2019t do it, can I? I\u2019m in your care.

Maybe I\u2019d have to dye them. \u201cSkull,\u201d I saidsuddenly, \u201cI\u2019m worried about Lockwood.\u201dThe ghost seemed taken aback. \u201cLockwood?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHey, you know me. I love him like a brother.\u201d The face adopted an expression ofunctuous fake concern. \u201cWhat seems to be the problem?\u201dI stretched my legs out in front of me, rocking on the edge of the bed. I thought ofLockwood in the cemetery, and of him walking towards the ghost. I thought of anotherspirit that had worn his face, many months before, and predicted his demise. I sighed. \u201cIdon\u2019t understand what drives him,\u201d I said. \u201cMostly he seems absolutely fine, butunderlying it all\u2026 I\u2019m not sure what he\u2019s really looking for. It might be something that\u2019snot\u2026 that\u2019s not that healthy\u2026\u201d I let the effort peter out. It was no good. I couldn\u2019t say it.\u201cWell, thanks for that,\u201d the ghost said, after waiting to check I\u2019d really finished. \u201cAprobing analysis. And about as clear as a bucketful of mud.\u201dI shook my head, suddenly annoyed with myself. What was I thinking? I couldn\u2019t talkto a haunted skull about Lockwood\u2019s parents or the graveyard. The idea was absurd. \u201cIknow you don\u2019t care,\u201d I said, \u201cbut I just wondered if you\u2019d noticed anything\u2026\u201d I got up,reaching for a towel. \u201cForget it. It\u2019s not important.\u201d\u201cI mean, it\u2019 s not as if I\u2019m renowned for my empathy, anyway,\u201d the ghost said. \u201cIt\u2019 s along time since I\u2019ve been alive. I\u2019ve forgotten what it feels like, having mortalmotivations. And of course I hardy know Lockwood at all.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all right. It\u2019s not a problem.\u201d\u201cApart from his recklessness, his deep-rooted feelings of personal loss, his mild self-absorption, his obsession with avenging his family\u2019 s loss, and his obvious death-wish, Icouldn\u2019t tell you anything about him. You and me, we\u2019re just as clueless as each other,eh?\u201d the skull added. \u201cAh, well.\u201dI paused with the towel in my hand. \u201cWhat did you say?

He was on hisway home from sorting a Lurker case in Rotherhithe. Walking alone. Someone lay in waitfor him. They beat him up and left him for dead.

Still thinking. Ask me again tomorrow.\u201d Alma Terrace, the location for our meeting with Inspector Barnes, turned out to be a soot-stained row of narrow houses in north-west London. A few old rusted ghost lamps linedthe northern side, flashing vainly at the coming dusk. We walked between them, fromlight to dark to light again, looking for Number 17.Net curtains hung in many of the ground-floor windows, lit by warm interior light.The blinds weren\u2019t yet drawn, and you could sometimes make out hazy images of peoplemoving in the rooms. Already, in their evening domesticity, they were detached from us.The curtains kept agents like us at one remove.\u200bInspector Montagu Barnes was waiting for us outside the gate of Number 17. It was adark part of the street, midway between ghost-lamps; we could see his crumpled formflashing dimly on and off as we approached. The house behind him was little differentfrom the others, except for the neatness of its tiny garden. It featured grass and gnomes.\u200b\u201cEvening, Inspector,\u201d Lockwood said. \u201cSorry we\u2019re late.\u201d\u200b\u201cDidn\u2019t expect anything else,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cIn fact you\u2019re only half an hour laterthan I requested. Nice one. I\u2019m honoured.\u201d\u200bThere followed the usual awkward interlude while we smiled at him in our young andperky fashion, and he regarded us with middle-aged distaste. There seemed somethingslightly odd about him tonight. What was it? Not his general bearing. As ever, hismoustache drooped as if shouldering the sorrows of the world. Then I realised I had neverpreviously seen Barnes without either his raincoat or his tie. Tonight both were absent.He had his shirt sleeves rolled below his elbow, and his collar was undone.\u200b\u201cSo\u2026 here\u2019s Number 17.\u201d George surveyed the building. \u201cIt\u2019s a sinister-lookingplace.

The chairs were upright, uncomfortable andclearly little used. There was a patina of dust on the table top. Aside from the ducks, therewere photographs on the walls of soft green hills, misty valleys, tumbledown cottages,expanses of air and nature. They reminded me of my childhood, far from London.\u200bA kettle boiled in the distance; spoons clattered; Barnes returned with a heaped tray.To our surprise chocolate digestives were included in the offering. The usual ceremonialswere completed. We sat in silence, with our cups and biscuit plates, facing the inspectorat the head of the table. It was an intimate setting, laced with ambiguity; we might havebeen about to join in prayers, or play cards for money, or do anything in between.

DEPRAC, the agencies, how it\u2019s all controlled. The bigoutfits are running the show: the Fittes Agency, the Sunrise Corporation \u2013 the people whomake a lot of money from the Problem. Independent operations like you are beingsqueezed out. I don\u2019t need to tell you this. There\u2019ve been plenty of announcements to thateffect this summer.\u201d\u200b\u201cThere\u2019s another one tomorrow, I believe,\u201d Lockwood said.\u200b\u201cYes, at Fittes House, and I doubt it\u2019ll be any better for you than any of the others.Still, it\u2019s a general meeting, so whatever new rules they come up with won\u2019t be directedsolely at you.

It\u2019s in your eyes. It\u2019s inthe way that Cubbins sits there, all smug and self-important, puffed up like a frog. I see it,plain as plain.

Seriously, it is.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to know. Mr Lockwood, you\u2019ve impressed a lot of people over theyears.

Whether Inspector Barnes\u2019s warning made any impression on George was doubtful. Thefollowing morning, as I made my way downstairs, his bedroom door hung open.

Back lunchtime. BE HERE!! But George was back even before lunch. Holly, Lockwood and I were in the basementoffice when a crash from the kitchen sent us scurrying up the iron staircase. George stoodat the table. He had swept the fruit bowl off it and dumped a great pile of documents in itsplace. He had a pen between his teeth; with ferocious speed he was swapping papers,selecting maps, spreading the pile around.\u201cUm, are you ready to chat about things?\u201d Lockwood ventured.George made a flapping motion with one hand. \u201cNot yet! Just a couple of things tosort! Give me an hour!\u201d\u200b\u201cDo you\u2026 do you want a sandwich?\u201d Holly asked.\u200b\u201cNo!

He should be here too. One hour.\u201d\u201cAll right. We\u2019ll leave you alone till then.\u201dGeorge didn\u2019t answer. He was in his own world, buoyed by the thrill of discovery. Atsuch times a physical transformation seemed to come over him. His weight dropped fromhim; he was swift of movement, light on his feet; Lockwood at his most panther-like andpredatory moved with no greater velvet grace. His spectacles shone with light from thegarden; in just such a way, one felt, the goggles of a fighter pilot would catch the spark ofthe sun as the plane performed miracles of flight high above the earth. Even George\u2019s haircrackled with new energy, swept back from his pale forehead like that of a racing drivernegotiating switchback bends. It was as if the sinewy intelligence that lay concealedbehind his doughy frame was suddenly laid bare; its quick workings transferred into thedeftness with which he organised his papers, flipped from one file to another, dancedaround the kitchen table, pausing only occasionally to scribble something down upon theThinking Cloth. As Lockwood later said, it was like watching an artist at work; you couldhave taken tickets for his exhibition on that sunny morning.  In the end Holly volunteered to hunt out Kipps. While she slipped out, Lockwood andI retreated to the rapier room, where our straw dummies, Floating Joe and Esmeralda,hung on their chains. Lockwood rolled up his sleeves and practised moves on Esmeralda.I did the same with Floating Joe. Excitement rose in us, expectation at what Georgemight reveal. We left the dummies swinging and began duelling with each other, grinningas we circled, feinting, dodging, making ornate patterns with our clashing blades.\u200bThe hour passed. Hot, sweaty and in need of tea, Lockwood and I went back upstairs.In the kitchen, the table and most of the surfaces were invisible beneath a sea of papers.George sat waiting. He looked sweaty too.\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d he said. \u201cPut the kettle on.\u201dUp on the sink, documents lapped at the base of the ghost-jar. The skull\u2019s face rolledits eyes at us. \u201cThank goodness you\u2019re here. He\u2019 s been like a plump whirlwind. And therewas a most distressing glimpse of pink flesh when he bent down to pick up a paperclip.I\u2019d have feared for my life if I wasn\u2019t already dead.\u201dWhile we were organising the tea, Holly returned with Kipps. All our essential teamwas there. Lockwood shut the door to the hall and drew the blinds at the windows. Thelight in the room became blue, dim and conspiratorial. We drew up our chairs.

They were the same.\u201cYou\u2019re a marvel, George,\u201d Lockwood said. \u201cSo who is he?\u201dGeorge grinned round at us. \u201cThis,\u201d he said, \u201cis a certain Doctor Neil Roberts. Notmuch is known about him, but he was personal physician to Marissa Fittes, and he tendedto her in her last illness. It\u2019s he who signed her death certificate, and he who confirmedher cause of death in a report to the media.\u201d He picked up the documents Flo had foundfor him, and squinted at them through his glasses. \u201cAccording to Dr Roberts, Marissadied from \u2018a wasting disease that affected all the organs of her body, and which had allthe aspects of premature old age\u2019. Sounds nasty, but Marissa was cared for up at FittesHouse. She didn\u2019t go to hospital, and only Dr Roberts had access to her.\u201d George put thepapers down. \u201cI\u2019ve been hunting around, but after her death he fades from the recordsand isn\u2019t heard of again.\u201d\u201cNot surprising, really,\u201d Holly murmured. \u201cSince he was lying in her tomb.\u201dLockwood whistled. \u201cMarissa didn\u2019t die. And the person who knew that, who\u2019d fakedthe official records, was silenced immediately afterwards.\u201d\u201cNo wonder he\u2019s so livid,\u201d I said. I still heard an echo of the whispered voice: \u2018Bringher to me.\u2019George nodded; he set the photograph aside. \u201cThat takes care of our friend in thetomb. The next question concerns how Marissa reappears as Penelope.

Honestly, those digestive biscuits have higher IQs than you.\u201d\u201cShut up,\u201d I said. \u201cNot you, George. The skull.\u201d I glared at the indignant ghost.\u201cIn fact,\u201d George said, \u201cI haven\u2019t quite got to the bottom of Marissa\u2019s transformationyet, though I\u2019ve got a terrific lead that I\u2019ll tell you about in a moment. What\u2019s known isthat after the old girl\u2019s death, her daughter, Margaret, takes over the agency.\u201dHe produced another photograph, this one of a young and dark-haired woman. Shewas officiating at some official function, and didn\u2019t seem to be enjoying it. Her face waspale and sad.\u201cMargaret was head of Fittes for just three years,\u201d George said. \u201cShe was a quiet,retiring person, by all accounts not well suited for running a big company. Well, shedidn\u2019t have to do it long, because she died too.\u201dHolly frowned. \u201cHow did she die?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not known. I can\u2019t find any proper death certificate. Then Penelope pops up. I\u2019vegot birth certificates for her. Hospital records, all the rest of it. Everything seems correctand above board. But it isn\u2019t. It can\u2019t be. It must all be forged. Because we know she\u2019sMarissa. Somehow a terrible transformation has been made.\u201dGeorge eyed us all over the top of his glasses. We waited.

The first two are obviously inaccessible, but I reckon I could blag my wayinto the last. In fact, I intend to, later this afternoon. If I can find this paper, it might justpiece a few mysteries together.\u201d George sat back in his chair. \u201cI\u2019ll try, anyway.\u201d\u200bThere was a general buzz of congratulations at this news. The only exception was theskull in the jar, which yawned and blew its cheeks out in cruel mimicry of George, but noone paid any attention. We all took more biscuits.Lockwood opened another pack of digestives. \u201cThis is great,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we cancomplete our picture of what Marissa\u2019s been up to, we can go back to Barnes \u2013 or thenewspapers \u2013 and make everything public.

Here\u2019s my analysis: I think Marissa Fittes and TomRotwell are to blame for the Problem. There. That\u2019s it. The end.\u201d He gathered up hispapers and tapped them into a neat pile.\u200bLockwood grinned. \u201cAll right, George. I\u2019m sure Quill didn\u2019t mean to sound sowearily contemptuous of all your hard work. Did you, Quill?\u201d\u200b\u201cNo. It was purely coincidental.\u201d\u200b\u201cThere. See?

We all know that Fittes andRotwell started out as two psychic researchers in Kent. I\u2019ve been through all the localpapers. They\u2019re first mentioned sixty years back, doing investigations here and there. Aswe\u2019ve seen, no one took them seriously at first. Ten years later, that had changed.\u201d\u201cBecause of the Problem,\u201d Holly said. \u201cIt had begun to spread.\u201dGeorge nodded. \u201cYep, and here\u2019s the critical detail.

Lookher in the eyes, and tell me what you see.\u201d\u200bWhat we saw when we arrived at the great grey building on the Strand were streamsof operatives from our fellow agencies arriving in the dusk of early evening. There theyall were: the pea green jackets of Grimble, the buttercup yellow ones of Tamworth, thestriped pink blazers of Mellingcamp and the rest. They congregated by the flower bedswhere ranks of lilies had been planted in the shapes of rampant unicorns; they filedslowly through the etched glass doors. Traditionally, herding so many agents togetherwould have been like shovelling a dozen tom-cats into a sack and expecting them tocuddle up and keep the peace. Rivalry between companies was deeply engrained, afunction of their independence; in the past, chance encounters in the street often led toarguments and even duels. Tonight, with that independence threatened, the mood wasdifferent, wary and subdued. Doors were held open for old enemies; muttered greetingsexchanged. Under the watchful gaze of many silver-jacketed Fittes agents, we shuffledthrough reception, and into the conference hall.As the venue for her announcement, Ms Fittes had chosen this mighty room, the Hallof Pillars. It was one of the most famous meeting places in London, a grand and gildedspace, where marble floors and decorated ceilings showcased the wealth and history ofthe agency. Nine sturdy silver-glass pillars stood like birch trees at the centre of the hall.Each contained an artefact of historic significance, a powerful psychical Source collectedby ghost-hunting pioneers Marissa Fittes and Tom Rotwell during the infancy of theProblem. By day, electric lamps illuminated the relics for the wonderment of visitors; bynight, the trapped spirits swam silently within the pillars. With the light failing outside,they were just beginning to stir.Lockwood and I took glasses of juice from silent attendants, and meandered to alocation on the fringes of the crowd. We studied the room. On a wall at the far end abanner had been raised. It had the words \u2018THE FITTES INITIATVE\u2019 written on it inassertive black. Below stood a lectern on a little raised platform; this was covered with adrape, emblazoned with a silver unicorn. It was almost identical to the one we\u2019d foundlying on Marissa\u2019s coffin, in the crypt just up the road.Soon attendees had arrived from all the independent agencies (even Bunchurch &Co., which in the absence of their leader was represented by two frightened-lookingyouths). The hall was almost full. The doors were closed, the lamps turned low. Withinthe glowing pillars, shadowy forms flared and darted like deep-sea fish. Servants entered,bringing canap\u00e9s on silver trays.Lockwood took a petite spring roll and munched it cheerfully. \u201cForget Tufnell\u2019s place,Lucy,\u201d he murmured. \u201cLook at this. This is a proper bit of theatre, right here.\u201dI knew exactly what he meant. The room was perfect for its purpose, which was tooverawe and subdue its guests.

We can leanagainst it and doze, if Penelope\u2019s talk goes on too long.\u201dIt was the pillar furthest from the lectern, at the margins of the crowd. It glowed witha pale blue light. On a steel rack inside the glass hung a wicked-looking knife with oddserrations, the very knife with which the Clapham Butcher Boy had worked his horrorsfifty years before. If you looked closely and at the correct angle, you could see just theghost of the Boy himself floating above and around the weapon. He wasn\u2019t the mostactive of the nine trapped spirits in the hall, but he always caused particularly loudshrieks among parties of touring school children, his eyes having been put out by thelynch-mob that had finally run him to ground.From somewhere came the bang of a door. The noise of the crowd dropped, became anervous rustling murmur, soft and dry as fallen leaves.Sir Rupert was looking towards the side of the room. He gave a nod.The sound of high-heeled shoes echoed through the hall.\u201cUh oh,\u201d the skull\u2019s voice said. \u201cShe\u2019 s coming.\u201dAt once, Lockwood was at my elbow. \u201cListen carefully to what she says, Luce.

I know how busy you all are.\u201d Shewas looking at us all, the grizzled old supervisors, the green young agents, sizing us up,taking our measure. \u201cIndeed, that\u2019s really why I\u2019ve brought you here. But before I go on,may I just thank the heads of DEPRAC for inviting me to host this occasion. This Hallhas seen so many important nights. My grandmother Marissa often used it to\u2014\u201dHer grandmother\u2026 Even from a distance Penelope was clearly in radiant shape. Shecertainly didn\u2019t look eighty plus years old.\u201cSkull,\u201d I whispered, \u201cdo you see her?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019 s so difficult from down here. My view\u2019 s partially blocked. I\u2019m looking throughpeople\u2019 s legs. And there\u2019 s one agent there who keeps jiggling about with her particularlyenormous\u2014\u201d\u201cCan you see her or not?\u201d\u201cYes. It\u2019 s her. It\u2019 s Marissa. Clear as day.\u201dI shook my head in doubt. I turned to Lockwood. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\u200bBut I was alone by the pillar. Lockwood had gone.\u201cI say I know how busy you all are\u2014\u201d Penelope wasn\u2019t wasting time. She wasalready coming to the nub of the matter. After fruitlessly looking for Lockwood at theback of the room, I slowly, reluctantly returned my attention to what she was saying. \u201cBut\u2018busy\u2019 isn\u2019t really strong enough, is it?\u201d she went on. \u201c\u2018Over-worked\u2019 would be nearer thetruth. We are all of us struggling to keep afloat in the supernatural flood that threatens todrown our great country.\u201d A slender arm was elegantly out-flung. \u201cSee these pillars here?These famous pillars, from the earliest days of our battle with the Problem? Ninenotorious relics! When my grandmother subdued such ghosts as Long Hugh Henratty andthe Clapham Butcher Boy, she thought she was winning the war. When she compressedthe Morden Poltergeist into its silver teapot, she never imagined that two generations latersuch feats would be a nightly business for so many brave and selfless youths. All of usmight fill a hundred such pillars, and there would still be no end to the terrors we face.And at what cost!\u201dAnother sip of water; a toss of her long black mane. She had some kind of goldnecklace on; laced with diamonds, probably. It sparkled in the spotlight. Everyonewaited. We knew what was coming.\u201cWe all remember the difficulties of the Black Winter,\u201d Penelope said, \u201cthe longestand worst in the history of the Problem. Mortality rates spiked \u2013 particularly amongoperatives in smaller agencies, where resources were so tight.\u201d The dark eyes flashed atthe silent crowd. \u201cThink back just for a moment. How many of your young heroesperished in those months, trying to make our country a safer place?\u201d\u201cNone of ours did,\u201d I said, under my breath. \u201cLockwood and Co. was just fine,thanks.\u201d I glanced round; Lockwood had not returned.\u201cA new winter is coming,\u201d Penelope Fittes went on, \u201cwith forecasts suggesting that itwill be no better than the one before. Do any of us want to see a whole new line of littletombs behind Horseguards Parade? Do you want any of your employees to lie there? Ofcourse not. And you\u2019re quite right. Such mortality rates can\u2019t be permitted again. But Iam pleased to report that DEPRAC has been giving the matter some thought, and theyhave come to a decision.\u201d Penelope Fittes glanced up at the banner at her side.

Looking round, I was disconcerted to see the roundtranslucent face of the Clapham Butcher Boy pressed right against the glass, jowlswobbling, slack mouth gaping.

He took a sip of juice. \u201cDid I miss anything?\u201d\u201cOnly the whole speech.\u201d Up at the lectern, Penelope had finished her remarks with afew condescending platitudes. She smiled, waved at no one in particular, and left thestage. Click-click-click went her heels as she slipped out of the room. It was all done indead silence. A few flunkies followed her out; a door closed. She was gone.Only now did the assembled agents begin to stir. There was a low indignantmuttering, swelling into loud complaint. Then the uproar began.\u201cEveryone sounds predictably happy,\u201d Lockwood said.\u201cYeah, it was much as expected.\u201d Scowling, I gave a brief summary. \u201cShe\u2019s turningthe screw on us again. She had a nerve bringing up all the dead agents. It\u2019s nothing to dowith size of organisation, is it? It\u2019s all about the team. Anyway, we\u2019re coming under herthumb, like it or not. Where have you been?\u201d\u200bLockwood smiled at me like he was coming out of a dream. He didn\u2019t answer. \u201cWhatdid the skull say?\u201d\u201cSame as before. Yes, she\u2019s Marissa. Outwardly she\u2019s different. But her essentialnature is identical to when he spoke to her decades ago. And the odour of the Other Placehangs strongly round her.\u201d\u200bHe nodded absently, as if the information didn\u2019t surprise him. He moved back to let acouple of grim-faced Mellingcamp agents past. A wave of guests was making for thedoors. A few stayed to mop up the final remnants of food and drink, but most weredesperate to be gone. We remained loitering in the shadow of the pillar, where thesightless ghost hovered, staring at me from its pale blue prison. \u201cWhat\u2019s so frustrating,\u201dLockwood said, \u201cis that the answer to everything is so, so close to us right now.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve seen something?\u201d\u201cNo. I tried. I didn\u2019t find it.\u201d\u201cThen how do you know\u2014?\u201dHe made a gesture of impatience. \u201cOh, because George is right! This is Fittes House!She keeps it all close, that\u2019s how she retains control. She\u2019s not stupid like Steve Rotwell,building weird laboratories in fields, doing crazy experiments where anyone could justbreak in. This is where the action is. It always has been. George worked here once, andKipps did for years. They both said there are big areas that remain out of bounds toalmost everyone \u2013 whole levels in the basements, and Penelope\u2019s apartments up top.You\u2019ve seen the Black Library \u2013 that was full of secret stuff too. But it\u2019s the upper floors,where Penelope lives, that I\u2019d love to see. That\u2019s where we\u2019d find out the truth.\u201d Henodded towards a broad inner door. \u201cThe elevators are just through there, in the Hall ofFallen Heroes.

Some months before, Lockwood and I had stepped together through a gate made ofstockpiled Sources, where ghosts screamed in a perpetual whirlwind and the air wasdeathly cold. We\u2019d stepped through it and out into another world. This was a placesuperficially the same as ours, but different: a place where normal rules did not apply.The transition had been instant, sickly and disorientating, and the effects were almostfatal.Those experiences were nothing to the dislocation I felt now.\u200bThe hall looked ordinary, but the colours were wrong, and the objects in the roomkept slipping out of position. Holly was both close and very far away. She was talking;her voice boomed in my head like a ship\u2019s horn, but it was also too faint to hear.\u200bGeorge.George.George.\u201cWhere is he? What happened?\u201d Someone else was speaking. I thought it wasLockwood, but the rush of blood in my ears was like a floodtide carrying me elsewhere. Ifought against it, paddled furiously back into the present moment. Like Holly I needed toclutch at something. I jammed my fingers against the wall.  \u201cSt Thomas\u2019s Hospital,\u201d Holly said. \u201cIt was a night-cab driver who found him. Youknow that guy, Jake, we use a lot? He was turning down the end of Nightingale Walk.Just by chance, Lockwood, he was taking a short-cut. If he hadn\u2019t been, if he hadn\u2019t beenthere, Lockwood, there\u2019d have been no one with George until dawn. And then\u2014\u201d\u201cSo Jake found him,\u201d Lockwood interrupted. \u201cI get that. Where was he? What exactlyhad happened?\u201d\u201cHe was lying on the edge of the pavement, half in the gutter, and at first Jake thoughthe was\u2014\u201d she gulped back tears\u2014 \u201cwas just a pile of old clothes that someone haddumped there, Lockwood. A pile of old clothes! Then he recognised George\u2019s shirt.

My hand was clamped over my mouth. \u201cBlood? Oh no\u2026\u201d\u201cIn what position was he lying?\u201d Lockwood\u2019s voice was harsh; he fired the wordsout, forcing Holly to speak. \u201cWas he face up, face down, what?\u201dHolly wiped her eyes. \u201cHe was face-down, I think.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019d been beaten?\u201d\u201cI \u2013 I think so\u2014\u201d\u201cHe wasn\u2019t conscious?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cDid he regain consciousness at any time?\u201d\u201cNo. He was taken to the hospital. Jake called a night-ambulance. Luckily there wasone near. He went with them. George is there now.\u201d\u201cAny word on how he is?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dLockwood was moving down the corridor. His face was stricken, his jaw clampedtight. He brushed past Holly like she wasn\u2019t there. Then he stopped. \u201cHow did you hearabout it?\u201d he said. \u201cI thought you\u2019d gone home.\u201d\u201cI had. Jake knows where I live; he\u2019s driven me back before now. He tried here first,then called round on me. I came back, waited for you\u2014\u201d\u201cAll right. I\u2019m going to make some calls.\u201d He walked towards the kitchen.\u201cLockwood,\u201d I said, \u201cshouldn\u2019t we\u2014?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to make some calls.

Their sequence is unclear. Time did strange things. I have no ideahow long I spent anywhere or in what order \u2013 in the hospital; in the hall with Holly; later(it must have been later, after our fruitless return from St Thomas\u2019s, with no word onGeorge\u2019s condition) sitting with her under a blanket on the sofa, sleepless and silent,waiting for Lockwood to return. For some reason I remember the lights the most: thecrystal skull lamp in the hall; the tasselled lantern on the living room cabinet; most of allthe truncated strip-lights crossing the ceiling in the hospital reception like a row of minussigns, like centre markings on a road to nowhere, with the iron ghost-wards danglingbeside them, moving in the air-conditioned breeze. Lights, always lights; strong, weak,harsh or warm, but always indifferent and always on. It was a night without darkness;you couldn\u2019t switch off or look away.How did I get to the hospital? How did I get back? I don\u2019t remember. Lockwood wasthere with me, at least at first. I have a snapshot of him in a car, the white glow of theghost-lamps (those lights again) flashing across his pale blank face, and me beingfrightened to talk to him. We did not talk, not then, nor during the endless waiting. Wewere not permitted to see George. We were not told how he was, or where he was. I havea memory of someone (Lockwood? Me?) kicking a chair across the reception room, but Ihave no memory of the lead-up to it, nor the consequences, if there were any. At somepoint, Inspector Barnes was there, and also Quill Kipps, though neither of them stayedlong. Then \u2013 somehow \u2013 I was back at Portland Row with Holly, a bowl of popcornwedged between us, and the white dawn showing through the messy crack in the half-drawn curtains.Night bled into morning and Lockwood did not return. He did not come back fromthe hospital all that day. He sent word through Kipps, who showed up periodically,gallows-eyed and unshaven, with brief accounts of what was going on. What was goingon was nothing. Nothing to stop the high, thin noise (too high, too thin to technically be ascream) that rang continuously in my head. George remained unconscious. He hadsuffered head injuries, and multiple contusions on his back, arms and legs. Lockwood hadbeen allowed to see him, but only briefly. There was no point coming to the hospital. Wewould only be turned away.Holly and I stumbled through what chores we could, focusing on insignificant detailsin an effort to pummel our existence into some semblance of rightness. I cancelled anumber of appointments we had for the evening. Holly tried doing some paperwork, butquickly gave it up. Instead we roamed the house. We sorted salt-bombs and refilled ironcanisters. Holly went shopping. She bought considerable amounts of doughnuts andcream buns, but somehow neither of us could bear looking at them. We put them in acupboard. The day drifted on and on like this, and neither of us could sleep.Whether through some quirk of empathy or (more likely) an acute sense of selfpreservation, the skull in the jar did not try speaking to me. My head was empty of itspsychic interference, which was a relief. In truth, though, it was empty of everything. Iwas scoured out, waiting.Towards evening a final message from Lockwood came via Kipps. It bought newsthat I interpreted as hopeful, in the same way that a drowning man looks favourably at anoutstretched twig. George was showing signs of responsiveness for the first time.

She brought someblack things in a pot.\u201d Lockwood rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cI hope to Christ they weregrapes, but with Flo you just can\u2019t tell.\u201dI drank my tea, letting its warmth run through me.

Can we go and see himnow?\u201dThat\u2019s technically how I phrased it, but it wasn\u2019t really a question. The bedroom door was slightly ajar, and we were able to push it open without a sound. Inthe usual way Lockwood\u2019s room was the opposite of George\u2019s, being clean and tidy andsparsely furnished. Not that I went in it much, but I\u2019d always linked it with sunlight andsmooth white sheets and with the smell of lavender. The sight of Flo Bones squatting inthe armchair like a death-cap toadstool come to life blew such associations into sweetoblivion. She lifted her straw hat up a notch and made stern shushing gestures. The airsmelt antiseptic and also somehow stale and muddy, courtesy of Flo; the curtains werepart drawn. The bed was dim, the covers rumpled. It was hard to see its occupant at all.\u200bWe stole across the carpet.

In fact he was damn vague. Thisdidn\u2019t bother me particularly, because I knew he\u2019d think of something. I just guessed itwould take him a while to figure out a plan.\u200bIn this I was quite wrong. Lockwood not only had a plan, it was already well underway. In fact I discovered afterwards that he had been devising his response to the attackon George almost from the moment that it happened. During his long vigil in the hospital,his initial shock had hardened into furious intent. He\u2019d had plenty of time to explore hisoptions, take decisions, and set his strategy in motion. But I only began to realise thiswhen Quill Kipps showed up later that morning with a bulging plastic bag in his hand.\u200b\u201cHere you are, Lockwood,\u201d he said, pouring the contents out on the kitchen table.\u201cFour black balaclavas, four sets of thin black gloves.

Will it be feasible?\u201d\u200b\u201cAt the worst, we might have to duff up a few pensioners.\u201d\u200b\u201cI think we can cope with that.\u201d\u200b\u200bHolly and I had been following this exchange like it was a tennis match, headsturning in bafflement from Quill to Lockwood and back again. Now Holly raised a hand.\u201cThere\u2019ll be some duffing up going on right now,\u201d she said, \u201cif you don\u2019t start filling usin on this. No ifs or buts, please. Tell us what\u2019s going on.\u201d\u200bLockwood grinned round at us. \u201cCertainly. We\u2019re going to complete George\u2019sresearch for him. Who\u2019s up for a spot of burglary?\u201d A fly on the wall, lured perhaps by the prospect of one of Holly\u2019s cakes, wouldn\u2019t at firsthave noticed anything unusual about our meeting in the living room that lunchtime. Somany missions had been planned there \u2013 why was this so different? But it was. Thereweren\u2019t any cakes, for starters \u2013 it would have seemed wrong to eat anything, withGeorge lying stricken just upstairs. No cake, no tea and no George. And we weren\u2019tdiscussing ghosts, either. We spoke in hushed tones, our faces pale and grim.Kipps got proceedings going. He took out a packet of grainy, black-and-whitephotographs and spread them on the table. They mostly showed an elegant black door,with whitewashed pillars either side. A succession of elderly, smartly dressed men andwomen were coming out of it. One in particular caught my eye.\u200b\u201cI know him,\u201d I said, pointing to a snap of a man with white hair.

As far as we know, there are only two other copies inexistence. One, in the Black Library of Fittes House, is too well guarded for us to reach.But the other\u2019s here at the Orpheus Society, and that\u2019s the one I intend to steal tonight.We needn\u2019t be embarrassed doing this, because these Orpheus people are definitely in onthe whole Marissa thing. Remember that old secretary talking to us when we visited? Hesaid that their main concern was winning a battle \u2013 not just against ghosts, but againstdeath itself. Which is pretty much what we think Marissa is trying to do.\u201d\u200b\u201cShe founded the Society in the first place,\u201d I said.\u201cExactly.\u201d Lockwood looked at us each in turn. \u201cEveryone up for this?\u201d\u201cOf course,\u201d Holly said. \u201cWhy do you even ask?\u201d\u200bKipps shuffled forward on his chair. \u201cOkay, so I\u2019ve been surveying the Society HQthe last two days,\u201d he said, \u201cwatching who goes in and out, seeing what the securityprocedures are. It\u2019s always locked up at eleven p.m. sharp. After that there\u2019s no chance ofgetting in by the ground-floor windows \u2013 they put up iron ghost-grilles after dark. Asecond snag is that the building\u2019s never empty. They seem to stay mainly on the lowerfloor, but activity goes on there most of the night.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of activity?\u201d I asked.\u201cNo idea. Could be meetings, weird occult experiments, or maybe they just doze infront of the fire. The members are all pretty ancient. You can see that from these photos Itook of them leaving in the mornings.\u201d\u200bWe inspected the pictures. \u201cThey\u2019re a bit fuzzy,\u201d Holly said.\u200b\u201cIf George was here,\u201d I remarked, \u201cwe\u2019d have floor-plans of the building, a full list ofaccredited members and a potted history of the organisation.\u201d\u200bKipps stared at me. \u201cEveryone\u2019s a critic. Know how I got these? I was dressed as aworkman, painting the railings on the house opposite. I had a hidden camera.\u201d He shookhis head ruefully. \u201cI tell you it\u2019s a devil of a job whipping it out of your trousers andpointing it at people without them noticing.\u201d\u200b\u201cSo I\u2019ve always been told,\u201d Lockwood said. \u201cHey, I recognise some of these people.Those are the old twins who run the Sunrise Corporation, aren\u2019t they? The society hassome very prominent members. How many are usually in the building overnight?\u201d\u201cAt a guess, four or five. The secretary always is. He seems to live there.\u201dLockwood tapped his fingertips together. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not ideal territory for a burglar.Still, they\u2019re just a bunch of old codgers. If any of them do disturb us, we knock themdown, tie them up and get on with the operation. It\u2019s not the most refined of plans, butfrankly I\u2019m not in the mood for anything more sophisticated. Questions?\u201d\u200bHolly raised her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s just I\u2019m not quite sure how we\u2019re getting in,\u201d she said.\u200b\u201cOh, don\u2019t bother about that.

By night, ranks of ghost lamps winked and shonealong every street, while runnels of water flowed beside the pavements, and braziers oflavender burned before the broad black doors. From the roof-top where we stood,catching our breath after the climb, we could see the purple embers glittering far belowus, and smell the lavender on the air. Somewhere far off, a siren howled. Lockwood wasstanding on a roof crest, staring out towards the west. A gentle wind swept his hair back,set the ends of his coat flapping. His hand rested on his rapier hilt. He looked pensive,even slightly sad.\u200b\u201cLook at him,\u201d a voice said disgustedly from my backpack. \u201cHe\u2019 s just doing that foreffect. There\u2019 s no real reason for him to be up there. Bet we\u2019re not even going that way.\u201d\u200b\u201cWe are,\u201d I said. \u201cThese roofs run all the way to the Orpheus Society building. He\u2019sjust checking the route\u2019s clear.\u201d\u200bThe skull snorted. \u201cOf course it\u2019 s clear! That\u2019 s the whole point of being up here, isn\u2019tit? Might get a few roosting pigeons, maybe step on a dead cat. Other than that, it\u2019 s aneasy stroll \u2013 if we could all stop posing long enough to get on with it.\u201d\u200bAnd it had been easy, up until that point. We had walked to St James\u2019s, almost to thevery street where the Orpheus Society was based, then detoured under Kipps\u2019s directionto a townhouse that was being refurbished in the road beyond. Its frontage was coveredwith scaffolding. Ladders took us to the uppermost floor, and a quick scramble got us onthe roof. We were in a landscape of moonlit tiles and shadowed gutters, a world of crestsand troughs that stretched to the horizon like a frozen sea.\u200bLockwood beckoned to us; he skittered down the roof on the far side, and reappearedby a chimney further on. Hoisting our backpacks tighter, we followed in silence, bootsslipping and sliding, trying to ignore the fearful drop into the street below. There were nopigeons, no dead cats; after a few minutes we came to a place where a twist of blue fabrichad been tied round a chimney pot, and a length of rope, end noosed securely around thestack itself, lay in a neat coil. Kipps had reconnoitred the way the night before.\u200b\u201cHere we are,\u201d Lockwood said. \u201cWe\u2019re above the Orpheus building now.\u201d Hechecked his penknife was fastened to his work-belt, and took his balaclava from hispocket. \u201cIt\u2019s time. Masks on.\u201dKipps was fiddling with his goggles. \u201cDo you think these should be worn on top ofmy mask, or underneath it?\u201d\u201cOn top, for sure,\u201d Holly said. \u201cOtherwise you\u2019ll look more than usually deformed.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. Need anything else, Lockwood?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Lockwood\u2019s face was hidden beneath the balaclava. He tossed the end of therope out into space. Now he took its length in his hands and began walking backwardstowards the edge. \u201cKeep your eye on the rope,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll tug it when it\u2019s safe to comedown.\u201dHe reached the lip of the tiles, and eased himself out over the void.

It contained an oval table with four chairs, a sideboard withbottles of water and stacks of glasses. A pot of biros sat on the table, next to a smallclock. The wall was covered in dark paper, and decorated with framed photographs.There was a strong smell of furniture polish and of lavender. Automatically, I used myTalents too, though I scarcely expected any psychic disturbance. There was none. It was aprivate meeting room; I\u2019d seen similar in countless offices across London.I turned back to the window to help Lockwood bring the others in. In moments, firstHolly and then Kipps were dangling outside the casement. Nothing went wrong; soon westood together in the little room, listening to the ticking of the clock.Lockwood took another rope from his bag and tied it to a leg of the table. \u201cIf we haveto leave in a hurry,\u201d he said, \u201cwe throw this out and go down. No messing about trying toclimb. But this room is our exit. Okay?

We\u2019ll search systematically. Aboveall, keep it quiet. If we can do this without disturbance, so much the better.\u201dLeaving the lantern burning at the window, we crossed the room, our torchessweeping the wall. The photographs that hung there were mostly assembled ranks ofOrpheus Society members taken down the years, grey-haired men and women, straight-backed, serious of purpose. In some of the oldest, Marissa Fittes was also present, ashadowy figure in black, standing a little apart from the rest.\u200bLockwood slowly opened the door; beyond was a wide, dark corridor running alongthe spine of the building. It was dark, but lights glowed at the far end, where it openedonto a staircase. Thick red carpets muffled our footfall. From somewhere came theticking of another clock; otherwise there was no sound in the house.\u200b\u201cSkull,\u201d I whispered. \u201cSense anything?\u201d\u200b\u201cJust the flutter of your hearts, the taste of your fear.

Allwere smartly furnished, but otherwise unexceptional. But there was one door that Hollytried that was of far more interest.

Well, we haven\u2019t come here for this. We haven\u2019t timeto spare.\u201dEven so, we lingered. Other boxes contained silver gauntlets to wear on the hands,and mesh boots to protect the feet. Most of the boxes had names scribbled on them,presumably their owners\u2019; some were familiar ones, including heads of industry. Our eyesflashed at each other from within the balaclavas. There was triumph in our looks, but alsofear. Our finds had deep significance. Way too deep. We could feel an abyss openingbeneath our feet. There was a long way to fall.We left the room and moved soundlessly to the end of the corridor. There was astairwell there, lit by golden chandeliers. The stairs were carpeted in red; dark portraits ofaustere, bearded men glowered out at us from inside heavy frames. It was the kind ofstairwell in which you could look over from the top to see the hallway, three storeysbelow. We did so: lamps flickered on the landings below, but otherwise everything wasstill. Not silent, though. The noise of clocks was louder here. We could hear them tickingdeep in the belly of the house. It was a place that seemed very conscious about time.\u201cWe try the next floor, then,\u201d Lockwood whispered. \u201cEveryone okay?\u201dThree nods; four shadows stealing down the steps, pressing close to the wall. We\u2019dtravelled light for this raid, keeping our swords and explosive weapons, but dispensingwith heavy stuff like iron canisters and chains. The carpet absorbed all sound. Tiptoeinground the curve of the stairwell, we saw the third floor landing before us. It was much thesame as the one above. A plaster bust of a heavy-featured woman sat on a plinth, eying uswith pop-eyed displeasure. There were ferns in plant pots. Beyond was a corridor, and yetmore doors.Somewhere in the bowels of the house a door opened, releasing smatterings of distantconversation. Just as quickly, the noise cut off and everything was quiet again. We stoodfrozen on the stairs. Nothing further could be heard. At last Lockwood gave the signaland we padded down onto the landing.A quick glance showed us that the corridor was just as dimly lit and elegantlyfurnished as its counterpart above. No one was there. Lockwood moved towards thenearest door. As he did so, a heavy thud sounded behind me. I wheeled round, to seeKipps on his knees, trying to lift the plaster bust from off the carpet.\u201cYou knocked it off?\u201d Holly whispered. \u201cWhat did you do that for, Quill?\u201d\u200bKipps gave an angry gesture. \u201cI didn\u2019t do it for fun, did I?\u201d he hissed. \u201cI just brushedit with my backpack!

It was a broad, rectangular chamber, runningalong the street side of the building. Two tall windows looked out at the townhousesopposite. Each wall, painted a dark maroon, was inset with white wooden bookcases;between them hung old maps and paintings. Heavy reading tables were dotted here andthere, and leather armchairs, each with their own standard lamp. A bust of a dour-lookingman in goggles sat on one table. A vast and beautiful globe of the world, made fromcountless pieces of coloured inlaid wood, hung in a silver frame.\u200b\u201cGot to be in here somewhere,\u201d Lockwood said, spinning the globe gently. \u201cSo, it\u2019s abook called Occult Theories that we\u2019re after. Let\u2019s get looking.\u201d\u200bHolly set the lantern on the table; we spread out, scanning the shelves.\u200bIt turned out that most of the books had been bound in black leather, with the Orpheusharp imprinted on the front. They also had the name of the author embossed on the spine,and had been arranged alphabetically, but since the author of Occult Theories wasofficially anonymous, that didn\u2019t help much. Time passed; occasionally I went to the doorand listened, but everything seemed still.\u200bAt last Holly sprang up from a shelf near the window, with a thin volume in her hand.\u200b\u201cGot it!\u201d she called. \u201cOccult Theories! This is it for sure.\u201d\u200bWe gathered round her. \u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Lockwood said. \u201cExcellent. George will bepleased.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019d have loved this room,\u201d I said. \u201cSo much weird stuff. Look at this one: DarkLondon, an Interim Cartography. What do you think that means?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, but\u2014\u201d\u201cDid you hear something?\u201d Holly said.\u200bWe looked at her. \u201cHear what?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t know. A clang somewhere.\u201dI was nearest the door. I stole over, opened it and looked out into the corridor. Asbefore, the lights were low, the carpet soft and gleaming. The plaster bust stoodimpassive on its little pillar. I listened intently; aside from the tick, tick, ticking of theclocks, everything was quiet.\u200b\u201cSeems okay,\u201d I whispered, as I came back in and shut the door. \u201cBut we should getout while we can.\u201d\u200bLockwood nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ll study the book at home. Come on.\u201d\u200bWe picked up our bags, silently scouring the room in case we\u2019d left anything. Hollyadjusted the globe so that it was in the same position as before. \u201cNo traces,\u201d she said,smiling. We gathered at the door.Except for Lockwood. He was staring at the bookshelf next to him. All at once hedarted over, and pulled something out: it was a thin pamphlet, bound in black leather.\u201cMore stuff about Marissa?\u201d I said.\u201cNo\u2026\u201d He held up the spine to show us: the word \u2018Lockwood\u2019 was embossed on it ingold leaf. \u201cIt\u2019s by my parents,\u201d Lockwood said. \u201cRemember last year, when we met thesecretary of the society? He said my parents had once given a lecture here. This must be atranscript of it.\u201d He flipped the pamphlet open to the first page.\u200bThere was a vibration in my backpack. \u201cI hear noises,\u201d the skull said.\u200b\u201cNoises?

There was an unholy screech, a scream of metal. The door blew open.   \u200b16. Kipps yelled. A hideous figure, deformed and impossibly tall, was ducking through thedoor. It was a nightmarish vision: grey and shiny and bulbous-eyed. Its legs were insect-like, long and oddly jointed. Its arms ended in enormous claws. It was silhouetted in thelight of the corridor beyond. As it entered, it slashed at Kipps with its right hand, shearingthrough his jacket as he threw himself aside. Its left hand sought for Holly, but she haddropped to the carpet, and only a few strands of her hair, trailing from the back of herbalaclava, were sliced away as the claws swiped past.\u200bLockwood and I stood directly in front of it, as the shape stretched itself to its fullheight. Pistons hissed, metal squealed. Torchlight wheeled behind it, but the thing wasdark. Our brains were trying to process what we saw. Not a ghost \u2013 too solid, too muchiron for that. Monstrous, yes \u2013 but not a monster. At the heart of it, surely, was a man.\u200b\u201cWhat is it, Terence?\u201d a shrill voice called. \u201cWhat\u2019s in there?\u201d\u201cThieves!\u201d the apparition shouted. \u201cBurglars!\u201d\u200bI knew the voice; and my guess was at once confirmed, for at that moment Lockwoodstabbed his torch on, and shone it directly at the shape. The blaze revealed the secretaryof the Orpheus Society, long white hair pluming out around a giant pair of goggles, aloose-fitting chainmail suit hanging over his dark frockcoat. His feet and shins wereencased in the top of a pair of pneumatic iron stilt legs that adjusted, hissing, as hemoved. His hands wore metal gauntlets, their fingers ending in foot-long stiletto claws.He cried out as the torchlight blinded him, raising one arm before his face.\u200b\u201cThieves!\u201d he cried again. \u201cThieves in the research library!\u201d\u200b\u201cThen get out of the way, you old fool!\u201d another voice cried. \u201cLet us at them!\u201d\u200bA hiss and a spring; with surprising agility, the secretary bounded aside. Clustering atthe door behind him came four other misshapen forms, each one a grey-haired man orwoman in old-fashioned evening dress, goggles strapped to faces, silver armour clinking.The two women carried peculiar firearms, black, snub-nosed, with coils of rubber hosingconnecting them to chrome bottles fixed to the top of the devices. One of the men had aweapon that looked like a harpoon gun. His companion carried a squarish device strappedto his chest.

I thought perhaps he\u2019d been in one of Kipps\u2019s photos, but I couldn\u2019t be sure. Frommemory most of the members looked like him.

First, because I\u2019d assumed we\u2019d all remain silent \u2013 thesecretary had, after all, met us before, and might recognise us from our words alone;secondly, because of the way he said it, quietly yet with cold assurance, without fear,without haste, communicating utter unconcern. Where Kipps and Holly were calm ascornered rats; where I teetered on toe-tips, desperate to dodge the inevitable attack, withcold sweat soaking into the mask I wore, Lockwood stood as if he was waiting for a bus.He hadn\u2019t drawn his rapier; he\u2019d made no move for any weapon. A few feet away, gunbarrels tilted towards him, the harpoon point swivelled; some unseen mechanism fizzedand hummed. Lockwood just stood there.\u200bHe said: \u201cYou have a choice before you. You can either turn around and leave thisroom and go back downstairs. Or not. Which do you want to do?\u201d\u200bThe second woman, tiny, dark, and wrinkled as a currant, cocked her head inpuzzlement. \u201cSorry \u2013 is he talking to us?\u201d\u200b\u201cGiving us an ultimatum?\u201d Harpoon Man took firmer grip on the handle of his gun.\u200b\u201cYou\u2019re elderly,\u201d Lockwood said, \u201cand perhaps a little slow.

It shattered the glass, let the nightair in.After this, things got messy.Really, it was a pity for the members of the society that they still blocked the way out,otherwise we might have been inclined to leave them like that. It was a pity too that intheir shock and rage they forgot their sensible intention of safeguarding their researchlibrary, and began to fire their weapons. It had bad consequences for them.But not immediately. At first, the violence of it caught us by surprise.The grey haired woman with the tweed jacket raised her gun, and a jag of bright blueelectricity suddenly connected its nozzle with the wall beside my head. One moment itwasn\u2019t there, the next it was. It cut across the room like a scribble drawn by a giant child.I felt its force, smelt the burning wallpaper. Sparks fizzed on my jacket and stung mycheeks. She turned the gun, scything the light towards me. I threw myself over the tablebeside the plaster bust and rolled away behind a chair. Behind me something exploded;fragments of the bust cascaded on the floor.  I peered round the chair: both women now were firing their guns; the blue flashes casteverything else into semi-darkness. There was movement everywhere, the flash ofrapiers, the rush of forms. Another flare burst; in its light, I saw the secretary getting tohis feet. His face was a Venn diagram of black and silver scorch marks. His hairsmouldered; one strand of it was on fire.At my shoulder, the skull gave a long, low chuckle. \u201cThese old geezers are completelymad! I\u2019ve got to say I like them.\u201dA masked figure \u2013 Kipps, I guessed \u2013 moved past, sword drawn, to be at onceconfronted by the burly, bearded man. His funnelled apparatus was connected to aconcertinaed bladder, like a bellows or squeezebox, strapped under one arm. He jabbedthis with his elbow: with a pop, a glass vial shot from the end of the funnel, missed Kippsby inches and shattered on the wall behind. Colourless liquid dripped down; a familiarfragrance filled the air.\u200b\u201cIs that the best you can do?\u201d Kipps called. \u201cLavender water?

Thewatery substance was eating into the wallpaper, making it bubble and foam; small bits ofplaster dropped in wet gobbets to the floor.\u200b\u201cPossibly a bit of acid in there too,\u201d I said.\u201cNice!\u201d the skull said. \u201cThey\u2019re totally insane!\u201dKipps and I took hold of the armchair, driving it forwards, colliding forcefully withthe bearded man. He gasped in pain. The funnel popped; a vial of acid ricocheted off theceiling and burst nearby. Elsewhere in the room, someone screamed. I had time to hopethis wasn\u2019t Holly.

Itwas understandable they were a little tetchy; what with that, and their superior firepower,they\u2019d probably assumed they\u2019d win the day. But crazed as they were, roused to fury bythe damage to their property, they couldn\u2019t match the ferocity that now erupted in all fourof us. I\u2019d never punched an old lady before; I didn\u2019t have any problem doing so now.In a way, they were unlucky, for it wasn\u2019t really to do with them. It was a reaction thathad been building in us for days, since George. Our anger needed an outlet, and here weresome senior citizens in armour trying to kill us. That pretty much fitted the bill.During the next few minutes, we notched up many firsts. There was Lockwood,slicing off the secretary\u2019s metal fingers, first from one gauntlet, then the other. There wasKipps, grappling with the bearded man, pulling at his whiskers and upending him; as hesought to rise, sticking his rapier straight into the motor of his bulb-gun, so that itexploded in a ball of pulsing light. And there was Holly, dodging the savage blows of thelong-haired woman; leaping to the giant wooden globe and shoving it over, so that itpinned her against the floor.Me, I\u2019d got up, retrieved the discarded electrical gun and switched on the dial. Thetiny woman in silver armour had likewise struggled up. She rushed at me, shrieking: Iflicked the trigger, sending out a jolt of electric current that blew her straight through thenearest wall in a shower of bricks and plaster.The bearded man lay insensible beneath the smoking, twisted coils of his brassfunnel. Harpoon Man, however, had readied his gun. He levelled it at Kipps. Hollyscreamed a warning. Kipps ducked; the bolt shot over his head. I hit the man with anotherblast from the gun that sent him back into a chair and the chair back into a bookcase. Ittoppled over, burying him.The skull uttered whoops of glee. \u201cThis is great. You\u2019re just as bad as them! Worse, infact. They don\u2019t know what\u2019 s hit them!\u201dAnd the tide of the battle was turning. The grey haired woman had wriggled out fromunder the globe. She fled for the door. So too the secretary; hissing and clanking on hisstilt-legs, swinging his clawless metal hands. They arrived at the door at the same time,fighting with each other to be first to pass through. Lockwood and I walked after them, hewith his rapier, me holding the gun. Out into the corridor we went, towards the landing,stepping over the dust and debris and scattered bricks; also the unconscious body of thetiny woman, which lodged half in and half out of the wall.The fugitives reached the landing, at the head of the stairs. As the woman turned to godown, I caught her with a bolt of electricity that sent her through the banisters and outover the stairwell to land in a chandelier. There she swung, senseless and dangling, in asorry mess of crystal shards and smoking tweed.Here too the secretary had his final stand. Perhaps with his stilt legs, he couldn\u2019teasily descend the stairs; perhaps his desperation had turned to defiance at the last. Eitherway, he turned and held his ground, as Lockwood approached, calm and remorseless,rapier at the ready.\u201cYou\u2019ll die for this!\u201d he cried. \u201cShe\u2019ll make you pay!\u201dHe swung out blindly with an arm.

Only on reaching the landing did he fix it to his belt.\u200b\u201cCan we go now, please?\u201d Holly asked in a small voice.\u200bLockwood nodded. \u201cFirst we need to stop off at that storeroom upstairs.\u201d It was shortly after two a.m when we arrived back at Portland Row. It was silent in thehouse; nothing could be heard from George or Flo.Lockwood held a heavy bag, containing items from the storeroom. He lowered it ontothe table, then pulled his balaclava off. There was blood on his face. He scratched at hisflop of hair. \u201cCheck the front, Hol,\u201d he said. \u201cSee if anyone\u2019s watching the house. Masksoff, everyone. Gloves, too.

The smell of smoke rose from ourtattered clothes. Our faces and hands were bruised and bloodied, our expressions blank.The same thought was going through all our minds.\u201cSo\u2026 think they recognised us?\u201d Kipps said at last.We all looked at Lockwood. He was very pale and there was a cut on one of hischeeks. He reminded me of a certain apparition I\u2019d seen almost a year before.\u201cProbably not,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m afraid that they, or Fittes, or Sir Rupert Gale willput two and two together very quickly indeed.

Which makes it only a matter of time before\u2014\u201d\u201cBefore what?\u201d I asked.Lockwood smiled at me. \u201cBefore the end. But it\u2019s not going to happen tonight. I thinkwe\u2019ll have a couple of days while they get their act together. Which means we should getsome sleep. First rule of any agency \u2013 rest when you can.\u201d All very true, but I didn\u2019t sleep well or long. I was awake before dawn and walking in thequiet house. I thought Lockwood would be sleeping on the couch in the living room, butthe door was open, the room empty.I looked into the library. The curtains were open and light was coming in, pale whiteand cold. There was a smell of wood-smoke, but the fire had burned out and the air waschilly. Lockwood sat in his favourite chair, a blanket over his knees. His reading lightshone over his shoulder, making a small, harsh circle of redundant brightness in his lap. Itilluminated the pamphlet we\u2019d stolen from the Orpheus Society, lying open, face downbetween his hands. He had his eyes half open, and was staring towards the window.\u200bI sat beside him on the arm of the chair, and switched off the light. \u201cNot been to bed?\u201dI asked.\u200bHe shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve been reading my parents\u2019 last lecture.\u201dI waited.

It gives an account of how thepeople of those countries deal with ancestral spirits. There\u2019s lots about how the bones ofthe dead are stored in special spirit-houses set away from the village, so they\u2019re kept outof trouble. And how the shamans or witchdoctors dress up in spirit-capes, like the oneswe\u2019ve got upstairs, and go to the houses to consult the ancestors. That\u2019s not so new. Theytalked about that in other papers, as you know. But then my mother and father home in onwhat they think is going on in those spirit houses\u2026\u201dHe had found the extract he wanted; he knew the piece by heart. He smoothed out thepage and, holding it up to catch the frail light of morning, began to read: \u201cSo the wise men truly converse with the ancestors: that is one point onwhich they all insist. But there is another point too, even more incredibleto the modern ear. When they enter the spirit houses, so the wise menbelieve, they are no longer in the mortal world at all, but have passedthrough to another realm altogether. This is the realm of the ancestors, theland of death, where they can meet with ghosts on level terms. How canthis be, we asked them; how can your mortal bodies withstand the terribleconditions there (for it is not a pleasant place), and would not theproximity of the dead be fatal to you? \u2018All this would indeed be true,\u2019came the reply, \u2018were it not for the stout protection afforded by our cloaksand masks. The precious materials of the cloaks shield our bodies andkeep the ancestors from touching us. The bone masks (formed from theremains of shamans of the past) allow us to see the spirits with clear eyes.\u2019To our mind, these fragile items look scarcely capable of any of this,but the wise men are confident in their power. Yet even so, speaking withthe ancestors is not to be taken lightly. The elders regard it as a mostdangerous venture to be undertaken only in times of crisis, for the dead areroused to great excitement by their arrival, often following them back intothe living world. This is why the spirit houses are built away from thevillages, usually across streams. \u201cYou see what they\u2019re stumbling towards, Lucy?\u201d Lockwood said. \u201cThey\u2019rerecording the exact same thing that\u2019s going on here \u2013 the living travelling to the land ofthe dead. They\u2019ve spotted everything: the way the dead get stirred up, the importance ofhaving lots of Sources piled together to create a door through, the need for bodilyprotection on the Other Side. It\u2019s all there.\u201dI nodded slowly. \u201cThe bit about the bone masks is interesting,\u201d I said. \u201cYou think theyoperate a bit like the goggles Kipps got?\u201d\u201cI hadn\u2019t thought of that. Yes, maybe. Though I bet the goggles are copying themasks, in just the same way that those silver capes we nicked are close copies of theoriginal spirit-capes.

Yet could it be that the prime cause of this crisis issomewhere near us, right under our noses? Are we, somehow, disturbingthese spirits? Could there be a gate, such as we have described, withmortal traffic going through it? The idea seems absurd, and yet surely itsatisfies the evidence. We feel this theory must be explored.

First the attack on George, and now our retaliatory expedition: lines hadbeen crossed by both sides now, and there was no possibility of returning to the watchfultruce of a few days previously. Consequences were inevitable; the question was in whatform they would come. Personally I expected a rapid payback. It wouldn\u2019t have surprisedme if Marissa Fittes and a crack DEPRAC team had shown up before lunchtime to leadus away in chains.\u200bBut nothing like that happened. The day was quiet, and Lockwood took theopportunity to make preparations.

In sharp contrast to our normal habit, the door was wide open, and the emanationsfrom the death-glow above the bed pulsed across the landing. We had broken open thefinal tea-crate and, amid a surf of scattered wood shavings, were unwrapping the objectsit contained. There were wooden masks and carven sticks, brightly coloured pottery jarssealed with wax, opaque glass bottles, and \u2013 our prize discovery \u2013 one resplendent cloakof iridescent feathers, pink and orange and shining in the sun.

In the late afternoon, Kipps returned, to be followed soon after bya large delivery lorry, inching its way down Portland Row. It came from a builder\u2019ssupply yard; under Kipps\u2019s direction, men began unloading large sections of chipboard,tools, ropes and other materials, and dumped them in the hall. Before they could depart, aMullet\u2019s van showed up, bringing fresh quantities of iron, salt and new magnesium flares,and there was a great kerfuffle in the street as the vehicles struggled to pass each other.\u200bWe took possession of the deliveries and shut the door on the shouting men andhonking of horns. Holly and I took organised the agency supplies, Lockwood and Kippsthe wood and tools. Very soon banging noises began downstairs.\u200bAt teatime, we gathered in the kitchen for a meal. The day was almost over, and stillthere had been no sign of our enemies, no attack, no retribution.\u200b\u201cIt\u2019s weird,\u201d I said. \u201cI was sure we\u2019d have been arrested by now.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about that,\u201d Lockwood said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they can just arrest usup front. They know, or guess, we\u2019d kick up a fuss and raise a lot of awkward questions.\u201d\u201cOr kill us,\u201d Kipps said. He had placed a hacksaw on the table before taking his plateof sandwiches, and there was sawdust in his hair.Lockwood nodded. \u201cThat\u2019ll certainly be their preferred option. But they can\u2019t easilybump us off, either. It\u2019s one thing to beat up George in the street. It\u2019s quite another todispose of all of us. That would take a concerted effort \u2013 and would be very risky forwhoever did it, because they know we\u2019ll be expecting it. Also, the attack couldn\u2019t be inpublic for obvious reasons. Even Fittes can\u2019t blatantly authorise murder. That means it\u2019llbe done quietly, when no one\u2019s around. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m expecting a night attack hereat Portland Row.\u201d\u201cTonight?\u201d I said.\u201cWe can only hope not. We won\u2019t be ready. Give us another day and I\u2019ll be a lot moreconfident. Then we\u2019ll have upstairs done as well. We\u2019ll just have to keep watch and trustto luck. Maybe it\u2019s taking a while to get anything out of the Orpheus people \u2013 we leftthem in pretty poor shape.\u201d\u201cAnyone have a theory about those stilts that madman was wearing?\u201d Kipps asked.\u201cWhat possible purpose did they have?\u201dLockwood shrugged. \u201cIt was Other Side kit of some kind. All of it was \u2013 even theelectrical guns. All designed to keep spirits at bay. Didn\u2019t work quite so well on us, sadlyfor them. Well, if we\u2019ve eaten, we should get on. There\u2019s plenty still to do.\u201d Defending 32 Portland Row wasn\u2019t impossible, but there were definite points ofweakness to overcome. On the ground floor, the street-front side gave little cause forworry. The old front door was thick and sturdy, and fixed with so many locks and chainsit would have needed a bazooka to blow it down.

We looked at one another.\u201cIs this a private wake, or can anyone join in?\u201dThe voice came from the hallway door. Everyone turned: there stood George. He wasin his pyjamas, and very grey about the face \u2013 grey, at least, where the purple bruisesweren\u2019t blossoming. The bandage on his head had come away, and you could see wherethe hair was still matted with congealed blood. His sleeves were too short, and there werebruises on his arms. He stood awkwardly, limbs shaking, clasping the doorframe forsupport. But he was standing, for the first time in days.\u201cLook at me,\u201d he said. \u201cUpright again!

Dubious as Flo\u2019s gift undoubtedly was (my theory was that she\u2019d found the box floatingdown the Thames and had dried the chocolates out individually on riverside stones beforerepacking them), it was good to see George take an interest in it. And his interest in otherthings had reignited too. During the night he had read and thoroughly digested OccultTheories, the little book we had brought back from the Orpheus Society. Over breakfast,sharing tea and chocolates with Flo, he filled us in on what he\u2019d found.\u200b\u201cIt\u2019s by Marissa,\u201d he said. \u201cNo question about it. Hasn\u2019t got her name on, but Irecognise her style from the Manual and other works. But it\u2019s a strange piece of work.She must have written it when she was very young, because there\u2019s nothing about beingan agent, or psychic detection or anything practical. It\u2019s all much more airy than that, fullof weird theories about life and death. The thing that really jumps out is her obsessionwith the stuff that spirits are made of. She thinks ghosts are proof that this substance isimmortal. The body falls away, and the spirit continues on.\u201d\u200b\u201cShe\u2019s talking about ectoplasm, then?\u201d Holly asked.\u200b\u201cThe skull said she asked him about that, too,\u201d I said.\u200b\u201cI guess so,\u201d George said, \u201cthough she calls it by other names too: \u2018the soul\u2019, \u2018eternalessence\u2019, stuff like that. The thing that\u2019s interesting is that she reckons that if you couldsomehow capture this \u2018essence\u2019 and absorb it, it would rejuvenate your body and makeyou young again. Anyone see the significance of that?\u201d\u200bEveryone did. \u201cThe woman we call Penelope\u2026\u201d Lockwood said.  \u201cExactly right. Do you want that last caramel choc, Flo, or shall I have it?\u201d Georgepopped it in his mouth and looked round at us. \u201cThe thing is, if you read Marissa\u2019s ideas,she sounds completely cracked. And as we all know, she never went public with anythinglike that again. Soon after she wrote this, the Problem began, and it was ghost-hunting forMarissa all the way. But it seems to me,\u201d George finished, \u201cthat she\u2019s been quietlyworking on this pet theory of hers ever since.\u201d\u200bLockwood nodded slowly. \u201cYou\u2019ve hit it, George.

Always uncomfortable with a roofover her head, she had even less inclination to stay with the possibility of an attackplanned. Before departure, however, Lockwood took her to the library. They spoke therefor a long time, alone. Then Flo slipped away, leaving only a few dirty footprints in thehall for us to remember her by. We continued making improvements to our barricades.Mid-morning came, and there was activity at Arif\u2019s Stores. Two men were seen to gointo the shop, where they purchased newspapers. With these under their arms, theymigrated to opposite sides of the street and sat on walls there, one in shadow, one baskingin the autumn sun. Thickset and silent, they read their papers and smoked cigarettes;otherwise, they were as one with the bricks and the concrete. Occasionally they glancedalong the road, to see if anything was happening at number 32.Holly made a surreptitious foray over the back wall and out through a neighbour\u2019sgarden to the road behind. Here she discovered several other men loitering, blocking offthe exit. She returned to the house, having found out what we wanted.\u200bPortland Row was surrounded. The Winkmans had arrived.\u200bFor the present this didn\u2019t concern us. All our activity was within and, specifically,upstairs in Jessica\u2019s bedroom. George was in charge of this. An easy chair had beenbrought up from the library and positioned on the landing. From here, surrounded bymugs of tea and crumb-strewn plates, he supervised our efforts. At his side, the skull satin its jar, watching dyspeptically. It too was an advisor in the operation.\u200b\u201cHow many chains have we got looped on the floor now?\u201d George asked as Iemerged from the room, sweaty, thirsty and covered in dust. Lockwood, Kipps and I hadbeen setting up a circle for the past half hour.\u201cLots,\u201d I said. We\u2019d had to shift the old bed away from the wall in order to wind thechains around it. The chains were piled high in layers, sealing the bed \u2013 and its death-glow \u2013 inside a fat hoop of iron. It was the strongest circle we\u2019d ever made.George shook his head testily, and winced. He rubbed his neck with careful fingers.\u201cNot specific enough. We need at least five A-class chains of 50mm width.

The Rotwell team had done everything on amassive scale, with a double set of giant chains forming the circle, and a suspended ironchain (which crossed the circle) making the way in. The circle had contained a vastnumber of stolen supernatural Sources that, together, created a hole leading to the OtherSide. We didn\u2019t have anything like that many Sources, but Lockwood reckoned we couldstill force a breach, provided we used most of the artefacts from the walls of the houseand the boxes in Jessica\u2019s room.\u201cWhat do you think, skull?\u201d I asked.\u201cAbout what?\u201d The face in the jar wore an expression of supercilious boredom. \u201cIfyou mean Lockwood\u2019 s plan, I think it\u2019 s bound to end in your painful deaths.

You\u2019ll all be pushing up daisies tomorrow, one way oranother. Why not just relax? Forget the chains.

We were clearing the room out of everything that was inessential. Lockwoodhad been emptying the chests of drawers at the back, throwing its contents into bags.Now he was standing by the window, holding something up to the light.\u201cGot a problem with the circle,\u201d I said. \u201cGeorge and the skull reckon we need morechains.

It was lined with tissue paper. A golden necklace was coiled in it and,for its pendant, a shimmering blue stone, smooth and oval and darkly translucent. It waslike looking into the fresh, clear waters of a mountain lake.\u201cOh, it\u2019s lovely,\u201d I said.\u201cYes, a sapphire. My father got it out east somewhere, and he had this made for mymother. It was her favourite thing.

Who, for instance?\u201d\u200bWe came up from the underground station into the autumn sunlight. A steady crowdof people were issuing down the steps behind us, slowing the ascent of the men followingus. Lockwood touched my arm. Ducking out into the traffic, we ran across the road to thesubway entrance on the opposite side, and pattered down the steps into the undergroundsystem again. We returned to the ticket barriers and caught escalators back down to thetrains.  \u201cFor instance,\u201d Lockwood said, as we filed onto a northbound carriage. \u201cYouremember I told you once how Kipps and I first fell foul of one another? At the DEPRACfencing competition when I was young?

Fromthe west a spreading pinkness tinged the rooftops and bled like watercolour across thepale blue sky.It was that final flourish before the light began to fade and the city withdrew intoitself. Children ran past with hoops, played with footballs, roller skates. Couples pushedprams; you could hear the tinkling of their ghost-wards rising up the hill. Adult officeworkers, dawdling on their way home, bought cups of tea from vendors; the first night-watch kids leaned their sticks against the trees and played football or ate ice creamsbefore their shift.Lockwood came striding up the path, dark and thin and lit to shining by the sun.

About how theywere killed.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be sorry, Luce.\u201d He gazed out at the sunset, at the red stainspreading over London. \u201cI\u2019m not.

After a while we got up, picked up the chains, andstarted the long walk home.\u200b19. The watchers were back outside 32 Portland Row, two shaven-headed men standingsullenly on the pavement opposite as we pushed open the iron gate and walked up thetiled path. I gave them a little wave. We unlocked the old black door and went inside.\u200bThe hall had that odd, cold, slightly echoing quality that you usually get when you\u2019removing house. The air smelt of sawdust and chain oil. The chipped pot had a couple ofumbrellas in it, but no rapiers, which were now part of our defensive armoury. Theshelves were bare of their usual ornaments, and the coat rack had been ripped off thewall. Everything had been taken upstairs.\u200bIn Jessica\u2019s room, all the furniture, except for the bed, had been removed, and the teachests and other boxes were gone too, broken up and used as barricades downstairs. Thebed itself, with its death-glow still pulsing fiercely, had been pulled towards the centre ofthe room. Looped chains surrounded it like dozing serpents, and we added our fat new A-grade chain to the pile. Kipps had fixed two tall iron posts outside the circle on oppositesides and had hung another chain between them. He was just soldering the ends inposition. This chain crossed from post to post, straight across the circle, over the top ofthe bed, not far from where the death-glow shone. Piles of psychic artefacts from thecrates and the walls of the house sat ready to be put in position inside the circle, andHolly was in the process of doing precisely this, under George\u2019s direction. First, eachobject was carefully opened \u2013 wax seals cut, pouches slit, iron surfaces pierced \u2013 to allowthe escape of the spirit within. Anything that contained a Source was broken in this way.It was still daylight, so the work was theoretically safe.

The floor around the bed \u2013 except for a littleclear avenue underneath the suspended chain \u2013 was littered with broken objects. The lightin the room was failing slowly, and the air within the circle already seemed thick andhazy.

The others were more hesitant.Lockwood and George both shimmered with silver; their scaly cloaks had a smooth,reptilian feel. Kipps\u2019s eyes boggled at the multicoloured splendour of his featheredensemble, while Holly cringed at the patchwork texture of her pelts.In the jar the skull cackled long and loud. \u201cThis is like feeding time at the world\u2019 sworst zoo,\u201d it said. \u201cI feel like throwing you all some sardines.\u201d\u201cJust how many dead animals am I wearing here?\u201d Holly muttered. \u201cI look like a furtrapper.

You could feel the throb and pulse of the Gate inthe circle even as you went downstairs. Night fell. Out across London, the ghost lamps would soon be coming on.

Yes, it was unmistakable \u2013 somethingstirring in the garden. Swift forms, soft lumps of darkness breaking free of the night,slipping over the garden wall. They flowed up towards the house, past the apple tree,spreading outwards left and right.I stamped a warning on the kitchen floor. At the same moment someone \u2013 Lockwood,I guessed \u2013 whistled sharply from downstairs. Holly and I moved away from thewindows, nearer to the table. We stood side by side, facing in opposite directions. Ourswords were out. We gripped each other\u2019s hand.It was very silent.Silence\u2026 That was the worst of it. You hardly dared breathe. I stared at the gardendoor. We had the internal doors propped open, so you could see candles flickering downthe hall; that was the only movement, those tiny wisps of golden light. In the whole of 35Portland Row there was not a sound. Holly\u2019s hand was damp in mine.A little scuffle, perhaps on the garden steps. Holly made a small noise in her throat.From downstairs came the crash of broken glass.I glanced at Holly to see if she had heard it\u2014There was a terrific bang. The room shook; I saw bright white light shine for aninstant at the edges of the boards hammered into the garden door. The light of themagnesium explosion faded.

Maybe it\u2019ll put them off.\u201dIt didn\u2019t.

They came from the arch on the left, from the rear of thehouse. I plunged through, saw Lockwood and Kipps retreating from a massive, faintlyglowing form. Its outline was rounded, knobbly and ill-defined. There was a broad, low-slung node that might have been a head, the suggestion of sloped shoulders, gristlyprotrusions instead of arms \u2013 and nothing else. The rest was a shapeless, glowing mass. Ithung just above the floor, palpitating slightly, drifting towards us. As Lockwood struck itwith his rapier, the plasm parted around the wound and just as swiftly reformed.  \u201cHi, Luce.\u201d Lockwood spoke with frankly unnecessary calm. \u201cThanks for comingdown. So, you see we\u2019ve got a Limbless. They bust a hole in the door, threw its Sourcein. It rolled away somewhere by the washing machine. Can you find it? Quill and I haveour hands full.\u201d\u201cCould blast it with a flare,\u201d I said. I was already moving to the side, looking for anopportunity to dart past the apparition. Never get near a Limbless, lest it sucked you in.\u201cWe will if necessary, but I don\u2019t like the idea of all that plasm flying around in suchan enclosed space. Take a look. Just don\u2019t tread on the floorboards by the door.\u201dI darted forwards, ducking through a wall of cold, out into the scullery area at theback of the basement. Fragments of broken wood lay scattered, and our barricade wasalready part dismantled. Beyond it, dark forms worked feverishly to break their wayinside.I threw a flare to dissuade them, and by its silvery light scrabbled on the floor amongthe wood and debris and the odd sock and pair of leggings left there from our washing. Icouldn\u2019t see anything that looked like a Source. White smoke plumed above me. Thebarricade was smouldering with white tongues of fire and someone with an axe wasattacking it in a frenzy.\u200b\u201cHow\u2019s it going, Luce?\u201d Lockwood\u2019s call wasn\u2019t quite as nonchalant as before. Fromthe Limbless came a horrid gurgling sigh; from Kipps, a cry of fear.\u200bI didn\u2019t answer. I had my torch on, held between my teeth. I\u2019d opened a pouch in mybelt, held my fingers ready to grasp the silver-net that lay folded within. Where was thatstupid Source? The axe was making short work of the door. I knelt close to the floor-tiles,craning my neck to look down the side of the washing machine, among the fluff andbuttons\u2026\u200bThere! A roughly circular fragment of bone \u2013 a piece of neck vertebra, most likely,wedged almost beneath the machine. As I reached for it, the last remnants of thebarricade splintered. Magnesium smoke swirled, and a short but broad and powerful-looking man clambered through. It had been a while; the last time I\u2019d seen JuliusWinkman, he\u2019d had on a smart blue suit, ready for sentencing, and I\u2019d been high in thecourtroom gallery. Today he wore black and carried a length of metal piping, and I waslying on the floor with my arm under a washing machine. We knew each other, even so.Jail hadn\u2019t made him any less muscular. His arms were still knotted like guy-ropes,his chest and neck as massive as those of a horse. His lips drew back, the teeth bared ashe saw me.

Just dummies\u2026 The man returned his torch to his belt and inched intothe room, knife at the ready. Softly, softly, he padded across the space, making for thedoor to the storeroom, and the pile of sacks where we were hiding. As he reached themiddle of the room, Lockwood yanked on the wire, making Esmeralda swing abruptlytowards him like a floating ghost. With a stifled curse, the man reacted; the knife stabbedstraight into the centre of her stuffed straw stomach, where it burst one of the magnesiumflares we had hidden there. Searing white flames erupted from the dummy\u2019s torso in aspreading ring, ripping her apart, engulfing the man right next to her.

We should get upstairs.\u201d\u200bUp the iron staircase, round and round. A bullet cracked against the metal treadbeneath my feet, sending out a brief, bright spark. We burst into the kitchen. Holly andKipps were standing side by side across the fragments of the fallen garden door. Two menin black clothes were attempting to get in. The men had rubber bludgeons, which theywere swiping frantically left and right. Kipps and Holly swung their rapiers in furious,complex arcs, driving the men back, slicing gouges from the bludgeons, holding the line.\u200bA familiar face appeared in the dark behind the men.

I took my final flare andlobbed it at the doorway, sending Sir Rupert leaping back into the garden. Even as theexplosion sounded, we were already out into the hall and swinging round to climb thestairs.  On the landing, George sat calmly in his chair. He had been fixing up makeshiftspears, using broom and mop handles and some knives from the kitchen. He nodded at usas we piled up alongside him. \u201cSounds a bit warm down there.\u201d\u201cIt is.\u201d One side of Lockwood\u2019s coat was black and steaming, presumably from hisfight with the Limbless.

A moment later the barrel of a gun appeared around the corner.Three shots were fired. We ducked back as plaster fell from holes in the ceiling above ourheads. At the same moment, a swift, athletic shape took the opportunity to bound halfwayup the stairs. A familiar voice came calling up at us. \u201cOh, Lockwood\u2026\u201d it said. \u201cWhereare you?\u201dLockwood spoke quickly. \u201cI\u2019m going to buy us some time. The rest of you get intoJessica\u2019s room, put the cloaks on. You too, Lucy.\u201d Even without looking, he knew that Iwould disobey him. He drew his sword, stepped to the top of the stairs.At my back I could feel the pulsations of the Gate inside the room. I heard the outcryof the ghosts inside the circle. For an instant I remembered the skull, shut in a cupboarddown in the kitchen. I had promised to free him before this; now it was too late. I shookthe thought away. The others were gone into the room, Kipps supporting the slowlymoving George. But I hung back, watching as Sir Rupert Gale slowly clambered intoview. Aside from a peppering of magnesium salt, he had entirely evaded my flaredownstairs. He wore his usual green tweed jacket, a cerise shirt; his face was eager andsmiling.Lockwood waited at the top, his hair down over his eyes, his rapier ready. He wastrying to look relaxed, but I could see he was breathing hard.  \u201cAnthony Lockwood!\u201d Sir Rupert said. \u201cDo you realise you\u2019ve managed to putWinkman and four of his men out of action so far? Shockingly unfriendly, I call it.Where\u2019s your hospitality?\u201dLockwood wiped his fleck of hair aside. \u201cCome up,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019ll give you alittle more.\u201dSir Rupert chuckled. \u201cYou know,\u201d he said, \u201cfor months I\u2019ve been wondering wherethis encounter would take place. I must say I had high hopes. On some castle battlements,perhaps. Or in a palace garden\u2026\u201d As he spoke, Sir Rupert jumped forwards. He duckedunder Lockwood\u2019s first blow, and met the second with an easy twist of his rapier. \u201cButthis mean little staircase?\u201d he said. \u201cIn this cramped and dreary squat? It\u2019s a trifledisappointing.\u201dLockwood cocked his head to one side. He struck out again, parried, guarded his legsagainst repeated side-cuts and low jabs. \u201cAre you insulting my house?\u201dSir Rupert\u2019s eyes twinkled. \u201cWell\u2026 the dreadful sofas, those ethnic cushions, thatfaint, ineradicable smell of toast\u2026 It\u2019s all so frightfully homely. It\u2019s just I\u2019d hoped for amore glamorous location, that\u2019s all.\u201dSir Rupert moved up another step. Lockwood edged back from the lip of the stairs.Their arms were moving too fast to see now; the swords blurred and moved, melding theair white like margarine. The clash of blades became a continuous burr, a wall of sound.A thin red line appeared on Sir Rupert\u2019s cheek; one of Lockwood\u2019s hands was suddenlybleeding.\u201cI\u2019m sorry that Portland Row disappoints you,\u201d", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3175, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ddcf93ea-0721-41bc-b386-f6e2f9a1cf7b": {"__data__": {"id_": "ddcf93ea-0721-41bc-b386-f6e2f9a1cf7b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "108", "file_name": "Lockwood-V-The-Empty-Grave-First-Draft.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1aee7824-a894-4de1-95a6-b1d8777fa3e8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "108", "file_name": "Lockwood-V-The-Empty-Grave-First-Draft.pdf"}, "hash": "6abb685fb593d0bbc65659150f817455e1b98d60cab7ab765697f21e9e6540f4"}, "2": {"node_id": "783b7686-15e7-479d-9ee8-58702655cf81", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "108", "file_name": "Lockwood-V-The-Empty-Grave-First-Draft.pdf"}, "hash": "2b27871ba33f4cb476e4a7bbb240431007bb68702b01acf70ed16f48ddf526d6"}}, "hash": "274dbdf05341d625771b1cd659351560e0b8f59c0b04d28dd7d34c33bb5b23ab", "text": "sorry that Portland Row disappoints you,\u201d Lockwood said.

Almost at once, someone tried the handle of the door. A bullet was fired into the wood,but the iron layer on our side prevented it from penetrating.Lockwood took his silver cloak down from the rack, while I took the cape of feathersthat had already survived one passage to the Other Side. The others were dressed andready. Kipps had on his bird-of-paradise cape and his goggles; George, his silver scales.Holly was doing up the belt on her animal pelt combo. It was the same menagerie asbefore, but now that we were about to use them, the humour in those outfits was gone.\u201cDon\u2019t forget your gloves, Lockwood,\u201d I said. I put mine on.Something struck against the door: wood splintered. Even after everything that hadhappened, the violence of the sound made everyone jump.Lockwood scowled. \u201cThe axe again. We can\u2019t wait any longer.\u201d He drew his rapierand faced the door. \u201cI\u2019ll be last through. Who\u2019s going in first?\u201dThis was something we hadn\u2019t discussed. Obviously we\u2019d hoped it would never get tothis, but it was a bad omission. For a couple of seconds five faces stared helplessly ateach other. The axe didn\u2019t hang around for us: it chopped at the door.I was about to speak, when Holly said suddenly: \u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201dLockwood nodded. \u201cWell done, Hol. It\u2019ll be fine. George, you follow straight after.Then Quill. Then Luce and me. Remember what we said. Ignore the ghosts. You followthe chain right through to the far side. Then\u2026 you\u2019ll be there.\u201d\u201cGood. Come on, George.\u201d Holly held out her hand for him; limping, he joined her atthe chain.I gave George a grin. \u201cCheer up. You\u2019ve been dying to do this!\u201d It wasn\u2019t the bestchoice of words. \u201cSee you in a minute,\u201d I added. He didn\u2019t answer. His face was etchedwith fear.They set off up the iron chain, going steadily, hand over hand. Nearer and nearer tothe circle, to where the chain entered the haze of ghostly light and disappeared.A particularly loud crash came from the door. An axe-head flashed in the middle ofthe wood and pulled away.I looked back towards the circle. Holly and George were gone. The chain was empty,but it was still swinging in little rhythmic movements, crisp and definite, like someonewas moving along it. The ghosts inside the column of hazy light move agitatedly backand forth, keeping away from the iron.The sideways rhythm of the chain stopped suddenly: it slowed, hung still. When youlooked through the haze you just saw the bed and the chain vanishing into nothingness.There was no sign of Holly or George.\u201cIt\u2019s worked,\u201d I said. \u201cThey\u2019ve gone. Kipps, it\u2019s you and me next.\u201dKipps nodded, which sent the long feathers of his hood bobbing madly. With the bestwill in the world he looked like a drab and mournful chicken about to walk a gangplankinto a cooking pot. He grasped the chains and shuffled towards the circle. I was at hisback; even through my gloves I could feel the iron\u2019s cold.Something decisive happened to the door. You could hear the wood being rippedapart, the iron strips screaming as hands tore at them. Both Kipps and I looked back.Lockwood was standing there in the silver cloak, rapier held ready, like a sea captainreluctant to step off a sinking ship. All at once I had a fear he wasn\u2019t going to come.\u201cLockwood,\u201d I shouted. \u201cCome on!\u201dThe door was in pieces. Men were struggling to pull them clear.

He landed awkwardly, but lashed out at Lockwood with a fist.Lockwood stumbled; he was caught off-balance. Sir Rupert raised his sword to get aquick thrust in. I moved, but I knew I would be too late\u2014Then something else flashed past me like a vengeful chicken, striking left and rightwith a rapier. Sir Rupert was driven back against the door. He seemed stunned,transfixed; it was all he could do to parry the blows. Maybe it was Kipps\u2019s weirdness thatcontributed to his shock, the bird-of-paradise feathers bouncing and bopping above hishead, the pink plumage swinging wildly with every frantic sword-swipe. I think it wouldhave put me off too.Even so, Sir Rupert\u2019s skills remained. He began to exert himself. Kipps\u2019s momentumslowed, he backed away\u2026And now Lockwood and I were beside him. For an instant it was three swords againstone, the air a blur of movement and clinking metal. Someone slashed with a knife atLockwood through the broken door. He dodged, spun round and struck at Sir Rupert\u2019shead. Sir Rupert ducked under Lockwood\u2019s blow and thrust at Kipps\u2019s midriff. Kippscried out. I cut down with my sword, slicing Sir Rupert\u2019s wrist. He swore and jumpedback, holding his arm.That was our cue. Kipps, Lockwood and I leapt away and bundled ourselves along thechain, almost falling over each other, through the blast of cold, towards the rushingcolumn of hazy air. We went so fast we outstripped fear: without pause, without thought,we stepped over the humped coils of chains and entered the psychic chaos of the Gate. We were right on top of the exposed Sources, and their occupants were near. Unholyvoices screamed and whispered in my ears, using languages I didn\u2019t understand. Pulsingfigures stood on either side, keeping clear of the icy iron chain that stretched away beforeus, over the bed, into dimness. They watched us, clustering as closely as they dared.Kipps was stumbling, slowing. This figured: it was his first time. \u201cIgnore it!\u201d Ishouted. \u201cKeep walking, follow the chain and don\u2019t let go!\u201dThe bed was covered in ice, which cracked as we clambered over it. Not just the ice:the mattress itself was cracking, solid and frozen. Crawling things with broken backsskittered under it on hands and knees, like sharks glimpsed through the glass bottom of aboat. When we jumped down on the other side, they darted clear of our swirling cloaks.Another couple of steps and we were out over the loop of iron chains again and intosudden silence on the far side of the room.How quiet it was, and how cold.Not only had the psychic hubbub stilled, but you couldn\u2019t hear anything else either,not the shouting of Winkman\u2019s men, or the smashing of the door. It was very dark,everything lit by a troubling grey half-light. The bedroom wall, which was very close tous, was split with bands of ice. Frost glittered at our feet.\u201cMove away from the chain,\u201d Lockwood said. His voice sounded hollow in thestrange, dead air. Kipps and I backed away.

Yes, we can stay hereholed up in this little room, until we freeze or until Gale figures out a way to follow us.Or we simply stroll out the door. We leave the house and exit into the other PortlandRow. It\u2019ll be there, of course, just like \u2013 or almost like \u2013 the one we know. Easy. Then wewalk off across London \u2013 the other London, I should say. Where do we go? I\u2019ll tell you.We go to Fittes House. We locate the Gate that we know is there. We step through it, backinto the real world \u2013 and in so doing catch dear Marissa entirely unawares. We go there,and we get the proof we need to end all this. In so doing, we\u2019ll have turned desperatedefence into triumphant surprise attack.\u201d Lockwood smiled round at us. \u201cHow\u2019s that?You might almost call it a master-plan.\u201d\u200bKipps rubbed at the back of his neck. \u201cYou might also call it rank insanity. From whatyou and Lucy saw last time, this \u2018other London\u2019 isn\u2019t going to be uninhabited.\u201d Heswallowed. \u201cIt\u2019s not some crummy village, with a few dead yokels to worry about.

What do you think?\u201d\u200bI was thinking lots of things, mostly caused by the sudden uncomfortable realisationthat this was what Lockwood had intended all along. He\u2019d known we would likely getdefeated in the house; he\u2019d known we\u2019d be driven through the gate. He\u2019d planned it allalong with this extravagant counter-attack in mind.

Lockwood speeded up; we came down into the hall and hurriedalong it to where the door gaped open under the blank black sky.A thin mist hung over Portland Row and the street was white with frost. A dull hardhalf-light that came from nowhere kept everything in perpetual dusk. There were noghost-lamps on; the lamps themselves had disappeared, and the iron gates and railingsoutside many of the buildings were gone too. The houses were grey slabs.The figure was just visible, racing away down the centre of the street. It did not lookback. The mists swallowed it; stillness returned.\u201cWho was that?\u201d Lockwood said again.\u201cWho else could be in our house?\u201d Holly asked.A thought occurred to me. I knew someone who was. I looked back into the darknessof the hall.\u201cWait for me here,\u201d I said.  I turned and walked back into the house, feet crunching on frost. The wall beneath thestaircase was riven with cracks, some so big you could stick a finger into them. Thekitchen door was part frozen, ice melding it to the floor, and I pushed my way in onlywith difficulty. The room inside was very dark, but I could see there was no table there,and none of our cupboards or units. From the corner of my eye, just below the curve ofmy hood, I sensed their outlines, as if sketched in by a draughtsman\u2019s pencil, but theyvanished if you looked at them.As I had expected, a thin and rangy youth with spiky hair stood at the side of theroom, where one of our cupboards sat in the sunlit world. He grinned at me. Both hisshape and his voice were faint, perhaps the fault of the silver-glass jar that imprisonedhim on the other side.  \u201cAh,\u201d he said, \u201cI wondered if you\u2019d think of me. You got through, then.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAnd now you\u2019re going for a little walk? Off to the Strand, maybe?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the aim.\u201dThe youth nodded. \u201cDon\u2019t need to tell me whose plan that is. I know. Well, crazy as itsounds, it\u2019 s a better bet than trying to come back out upstairs. I\u2019d avoid this house in thenear future. They\u2019re not happy at all.\u201d  \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d\u201cIn simple terms, they\u2019re trashing the place. Sir Rupert Gale is using some very saltylanguage. Even I\u2019ve learned a few new words. Far as I can make out, he\u2019 s posting guardshere, in case you try to sneak back in. To be honest, though, he\u2019 s got his work cut outkeeping control \u2013 most of Winkman\u2019 s men haven\u2019t a clue what you just did, and they\u2019rewildly freaked out. There\u2019 s talk of witchcraft and devils.\u201d The youth chuckled. \u201cHonestly,the average medieval serf would have more wit than them. You\u2019ll be pleased to know thatmost of that crowd are injured too \u2013 stabbed, bashed and otherwise blown up by all yourflares. They haven\u2019t got an eyebrow between them.\u201d\u201cGood,\u201d I said grimly.\u201cOh, and Winkman\u2019 s just died.\u201d\u200b\u201cWhat?\u201d I sucked in the ice cold air. \u201cWhat? How?\u201d\u200b\u201cAs far as I can make out you walloped him with a floorboard. When he fell back hecollided with one of his lackeys\u2019 knives. Well, if you do go running around carrying sharpobjects, what do you expect?\u201d The youth gave a callous grin. \u201cThey brought him up to thekitchen, but he passed across just now.

All the same, I am sorry.\u201d He looked off down the road.\u201cIt\u2019s good news that he\u2019s not hanging around your basement like some victims ofviolent deaths do,\u201d Kipps said. \u201cOtherwise you\u2019d find his ghost glaring over yourshoulder every time you went downstairs to wash your pants.

Once,long ago, Jessica Lockwood had also come this way alone.\u201cWell, we haven\u2019t got time to stand around wondering,\u201d I said in a decisive voice.\u201cWe need to make our own journey. Who knows the quickest way to the Strand?\u201d  \u200b21. It was Portland Row. But it wasn\u2019t Portland Row, not with that ferocious, never-endingsilence, and the frost on the road, and the roofs and chimney pots merging with that dullblack starless sky. The houses were architecturally the same, with adornments that Irecognised from walking past a thousand times. Oddities of design were replicated onindividual buildings \u2013 from porches to loft extensions to distinctive patterns in thebrickwork \u2013 but the dull, dead light that shone over everything and came from nowhere(there was no moon) rendered them flat and lifeless, as if drawn on giant slabs of card.There was something false about those buildings. You felt that if you knocked themwith your fist, whole walls would topple down. And their doors and windows weren\u2019tright. The doors were either absent or ajar. They were gaping holes torn in the fabric ofthe street. None of the windows had curtains: all were stark and blank and staring. Itmade you feel things might be watching you from inside the empty rooms.  We walked down the centre of the street, huddled together, boots crunching the hard,white frost. A faint set of marks stretched ahead of us \u2013 the wandering footprints of asolitary man.

Thatleft us feeling exposed. Despite the mist that coiled around us, despite our hushed voicesand the stealth with which we took each step, we knew our very presence made usvulnerable. We did not belong there. We were too solid, too colourful, too alive to bemistaken for an inhabitant of that dark city. If they saw us, those inhabitants would knowthat very well.\u200bBut to begin with we saw nobody at all.There were no ghost-lamps, no railings, no cars, nothing of iron, and no runningwater. The drains and gutters were empty, the runnels dry. Street nameplates had gone,and the signs above the store fronts carried no legible words. The way we took wasfamiliar to us, but the overarching silence made it alien. I\u2019d been exposed to stillness likethis when I\u2019d crossed over at Aldbury Castle, but that journey had been in the open andempty countryside. Here, in central London, the utter silence had a transformative effect.It turned the rows of houses into cliff faces, the streets into a dark labyrinth of canyonsand ravines. When you drew close to the buildings, you saw that the brickwork wasbrittle and cracked; on some corners whole sections had eroded away, leaving vast holeslike a giant\u2019s bite-marks in the walls.The air was bitter-cold, a dry, dead absence that sucked the life from your lungs andthe motion from your blood. It clung to the surface of our cloaks, coating them with icethat creaked and cracked gently as we moved. But it could not penetrate. Whether madeby long-dead witchdoctors, who had sewn my spirit cape out of silver thread and birdfeathers, or by the modern day fanatics of the Orpheus Society, who had aped this artwith silver flakes and iron wire, the cloaks performed their function well. We existed infragile bubbles of warmth that sustained us as we hurried on. Even so, the hard, greysilence bore into our skulls, and the countless watchful windows on every side filled uswith a slowly mounting dread.\u201cCan\u2019t somebody say anything?\u201d Holly whispered. We were standing at the corner ofWeymouth Street and Portland Place, on a sloping pile of frost-blown bricks, taking stockof the next abandoned road. Holly\u2019s fur cape was frosted over, making her look like asmall and anxious polar bear. Strands of her hair protruded around the clasp at her neck,glistening straight and hard with ice. \u201cSay something, somebody!\u201d she said. \u201cThis silenceis going to drive me mad.\u201d\u201cTell you what I don\u2019t like.\u201d Kipps pointed upward. \u201cThat emptiness. No moon, nostars.\u201d\u201cBest not look it, the sky.\u201d George sounded tired. He\u2019d been moving slowest of all ofus, and we\u2019d had to rein in our pace to stay with him.\u201cBest not look at anything,\u201d I said. \u201cDon\u2019t look, don\u2019t think. Just keep going.\u201dLockwood returned from the corner, where he\u2019d been spying out the broad expanse ofPortland Place. He met my gaze and smiled, but you could see the effort it took, and theanxiety in his eyes. \u201cThe next street seems empty,\u201d he said, \u201cthough there are several setsof footprints crossing it. Don\u2019t know if that means someone\u2019s been here recently or not.Prints here might last a long time.\u201d\u201cDo we risk it?\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s very open.\u201d\u201cYes, but it\u2019s direct.

Now he stopped and pointed. There was a place ahead of us where the officebuildings sat back from the centre of the street. In the frosted square of concrete thuscreated, a group of people was standing. They had their backs to us, and the mist wasthick around them, but we could see that they were men and women and children, dressedin a great variety of styles. They weren\u2019t still, but shuffling and moving about with everyappearance of disquiet, and the focus of their attention was something dark that hungbehind them, black but also shimmering.I thought at first it was a door, though the shape wasn\u2019t right; then I thought it was ahole in the wall of the building, but that wasn\u2019t right either \u2013 the darkness seemedseparate from the wall, and somehow closer, and a corner of it kind of overlapped awindow behind. The figures were making a great effort to get closer to this darkness, butwere deterred by an object that I couldn\u2019t quite identify. It looked a bit like one of oursilver nets, only it was much bigger, and supported by poles, so that it resembled a littlefence. White flecks hung twitching and fluttering on the net. As we watched, one of thefigures, impelled by strong compulsion, broke free of the crowd and threw itself againstthe silver net. There was a soft sound, a flash of light; the figure was gone. New whitefronds hung twitching from the net and the crowd stirred with agitation.\u200b\u201cCome on,\u201d Lockwood whispered. \u201cIf we\u2019re quick, we can get past them.\u201d\u200bPressing close to the other side of the road, we made off down a narrow side street,looking behind us all the while. No one followed us and we soon slowed our pace, for wewere very weary. Weary \u2013 and perplexed, for now a new mystery hung over us. That darkspace preyed on my mind.

He was right, in a way, not to want to talk about it. Ourbusiness led us elsewhere. And neither of us wanted to re-enforce the tug we\u2019d felt, whenwe\u2019d looked at the strange dark voids. It was the tug you get on a crumbling cliff-top,when you\u2019re tempted to step close, lean over, and look down.\u200bAt the next junction, Kipps went ahead again. We watched him dart along the grey-black street, his boots sending up tiny clouds of frost. Halfway along he flitted suddenlyinto the shelter of a shop porch. We waited; moments later one of the inhabitants of DarkLondon came out of a nearby house, moved across the street and vanished in the shadowsbeyond, passing just a few feet away from Kipps without noticing him.When all was clear, Kipps peeled himself from the shadows and moved on. Presentlyhe came to the next crossing, where he looked in all directions before signalling us tofollow.\u201cYou\u2019re in good shape, Quill,\u201d I whispered, when we caught up with him.Kipps nodded. \u201cI feel great. Must be the effect of this coat or something.\u201d\u201cHow\u2019s the side? Not giving you any trouble?\u201dHe gave a shrug; he was already staring up the next street, eyes bright, eager to begone. \u201cIt\u2019s funny. In that last second in the bedroom, just before going through, I thoughtGale\u2019s blade had really caught me. And it did hurt a bit at first, but it\u2019s really calmeddown now.

And as Kipps said, Windmill Street did lookmostly empty. He was gone so quickly I didn\u2019t have a chance to ask him how he knew.\u200bOur cloaks were steaming thickly now, leaving a vapour plume that trailed behind us,coilingly persistent on the still, dead air. I disliked this trail. It was my habit to lookbehind me, check nothing was following in our track. At last, when I did so, I saw that wehad company. Some way behind us, a thin man had come out of one of the narrowhouses; he wore a pale brown suit and an old-fashioned, broad-brimmed hat. Ourfootprints passed right in front of him, and I had a suspicion that our trail of vapour didalso. He didn\u2019t look at us. He stood staring straight out into the road like he wasclockwork and his key had just wound down.\u200b\u201cTrouble behind us,\u201d I muttered.Everyone looked.

At the intersection up ahead, a group offigures stood near one of the shimmering black doors, which had again been closed off bya silver net. There were men there, women, children. They blocked the road.Lockwood cursed. \u201cQuick! In here.\u201d He darted to the wall on our left, where an alleyopened, a slot between buildings. We followed him in, ploughed down it. It was thenarrowest of gaps. Bricks brushed my cape on either side; fear gnawed at me in case itwould be ripped, as another cape had once been. I drew my shoulders in. The alleybecame narrower and narrower, I felt that I would be pressed to nothing. All at once itturned sharply to the right and opened into a tiny yard.High brick walls towered over us on three sides. In one of them, at head height, was arectangular opening \u2013 a door that in our world was perhaps reached by iron stairs. Therewere no other doors, and no routes through.  \u201cHell,\u201d Lockwood panted. \u201cDead end.\u201d\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d Kipps wasn\u2019t breathing hard. \u201cThere\u2019s a door up there.\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t go inside a building, it\u2019s not safe.

We can cut through here and out into another street quick as anything. Followme.\u201dHe drew his sword, briefly surveyed the passage ahead of us, then plunged along it,deep into the building. We hesitated. If the hall in Portland Row had been unpleasant towalk down, this was no better. The proportions of the corridor felt wrong, and iceglistened in fissures by the ceiling. There was a sour taint on the air.  Fingertips scrabbled at the wall behind us.You know, that passage looked just fine. We stumbled after Kipps as fast as we couldgo.My memory of what followed has the jumbled quality of a dream. We went downcorridors, up staircases, into rooms that led nowhere, doubling back the way we\u2019d come,expecting always to come face to face with what pursued us. We went through endlessdoors, some ordinary, others thick with ice and twisted into odd dimensions. All wereopen \u2013 no doors were locked in the dark, cold world. You could go anywhere, butnowhere was any better than anywhere else, and we could not find the way out of thebuilding. Sometimes we passed windows, but either they were too high, or too narrow, orso caked with frost that we could not see out from them to know if it was safe to jump.There was nothing but the scrape of our boots on the wooden floors, and our breath likebroken pistons, and the flap and flutter of Kipps\u2019s feathers just ahead. And somewherebehind, feet following.He was right: those old houses were a maze. We passed through attics, where faintoutlines of dolls\u2019 houses and rocking horses merged with spreading shadows; throughrooms where beds seemed half sunken into the tilted floors; through kitchens, where darkobjects hung dead and heavy from ceiling hooks; up rattling staircases that grew widethen thin with every twist or turn; and once, out on a high parapet that ran betweenbuildings, with the white street far below and ice shards tumbling soundlessly beneathour skidding boots. That street unnerved us, and not because of our height: a host of greyfigures stood in it, looking up as we ran like rats into the house beyond.And now there began to be noises from neighbouring rooms, as if things kept pacewith us beyond the walls. Kipps was cursing now, moving ever faster, shying away fromopen corridors, squeezing through cracks, dropping through chutes of ice and rubble; andall the while Lockwood brought up the rear, rapier out, steadily retreating, staring backthe way we had come.And then, all at once, we came into a room where a small child sat. It had a pudding-bowl haircut and was sitting cross-legged by an empty chimney hearth. It looked for allthe world that it was reading, but there was no book in the little hands, and the stool orchair that it had sat on was long gone too. It floated in mid-air, forlorn and self-sufficient,and there was something so pitiful about it that we couldn\u2019t help but pause.Beside it was something else: a narrow fissure, filled with light. It was hard to tellwhether it was on the floor or just hanging in mid-air. As with so much to do with theOther Side, you saw it best when you weren\u2019t looking at it directly, but there wassomething about the quality of the shimmer that made my heart leap with longing.Because it was not of the Other Side, it was not of this place at all.\u200b\u201cIt\u2019s a Source,\u201d George croaked. \u201cIt\u2019s where that Visitor goes through.\u201d\u201cBack to our world,\u201d Holly whispered. \u201cLook at the light\u2026\u201dTrust me, I was looking. \u201cCould we\u2014?\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d Kipps said. \u201cIt\u2019s too small.

We made like fivestatues, lined up by the door. Breathing wasn\u2019t high on our agenda, let alone movement. Iwas pressing so hard against the bricks I thought I\u2019d probably push right through. Myheart was banging like a bass drum in my ears; it beat so loud in the awful silence I feltsure the ranks of rushing figures would at once change direction and throw themselves onme.\u200bThere was sizeable company of them, twenty figures at least, adults mostly, butchildren too. They were passing along the centre of the road, neither walking nor exactlyrunning, but hurrying forth in a kind of stumbling lope. Their clothes were bleached ofcolour, their faces in dark shadow; there was nothing strong or definite about them,except the glittering of their eyes. But they pulled a cloud of longing and unhappiness intheir wake, and it swept against me in a great cold wave. The company came within a fewfeet of us, making no noise except for the faintest flapping of their thin, cold garments,and swept away along the road.\u200bWe prised ourselves carefully clear of the wall; in those few seconds frost had alreadybegun bonding our capes to the surface.

I was looking along the street where thewandering spirits had gone. Between the houses I could see a thin grey line, straight as apine tree, rising stark against the pitch-black sky. \u201cSomething\u2019s drawing them on.\u201d\u200bLockwood drew his cloak tighter and stepped off the pavement. \u201cLet\u2019s go and seewhat it is.\u201d\u200bIt was the way we had to go, for the thin grey line was Nelson\u2019s Column, and the roadsoon opened into the great expanse of Trafalgar Square. Not far beyond this lay theStrand \u2013 and Fittes House, our final destination. But all thought of that was for themoment blotted out by what we saw in the centre of the square.\u200bIn our world, the open plaza beneath the column was often the site of demonstrationsby people protesting at new curfews, or other restrictions caused by the Problem. In this,at least, dark London was no different, for a great congregation of the dead was gatheredthere. It was a host large enough to effortlessly absorb the little group that had just passedby us. I could not begin to count them all.The mass of spirits was pressing in on a low, fenced structure ranged around the footof the column. These fences were formed of silver mesh, similar to the ones we\u2019d seenblocking off the strange dark apertures at Oxford Circus and elsewhere. Within thecompound a small number of men and women in silver clothes were moving. Even froma distance it was clear that they were living. They had a different quality to the horde ofgrey forms beyond the barrier; they were far more solid, the hues of their outfits morevibrant and real. They bustled about with focused, purposeful movements, and faintmetallic clanks and clattering drifted towards us on the still, dead air.There was something jarring about the noise and the colour and the sense of purpose,something brash and inappropriate in that sombre place. Looking at them, I recognisedfor the first time how wrong it was that we were there.They did not wear cloaks, but long tunics hanging over loose trousers. They had lighthelmets, and goggles similar the ones Kipps wore. They moved casually, absorbed intheir work.

One of the group (a woman, Ithought) patrolled the inside of the fence with a device on a long pole. It had some kindof silver tip. Occasionally, in a bored sort of way, she thrust it outside to touch one of thespirits who got too close, sending it darting back into the crowd.A man emerged from an iron hut at the centre of the compound. He wore stilts similarto the ones the Orpheus secretary had used and had a large cylinder strapped to his back.As we watched, he slipped out of the compound and waded waist-high through the massof swarming dead, who rippled backwards they sought to evade painful touch of silver.Some weren\u2019t quick enough; we could hear the hiss and squeal of bursting plasm. Theman strode onwards, outstripping those spirits who tried to follow him, and disappearedthrough the mists in the direction of the Strand.We watched for a short time. Then Lockwood drew us close.\u200b\u201cWant to know the cause of the Problem?\u201d he whispered. \u201cThis is it, right here.\u201d\u200bHolly brushed ice from the sleeves of her steaming cloak. \u201cWhat are those idiotsdoing?\u201d\u201cApart from stirring up the dead, you mean?\u201d George said.

You can see their logo from here.\u201d\u201cYes, there\u2019s a whole industry going on here,\u201d Lockwood said. \u201cThe one good thing iswe\u2019re surely right to think we\u2019ll find a Gate at Fittes House. Well, we can\u2019t stop or we\u2019llfreeze to death. My bones are like ice as it is. Let\u2019s go and end it now.\u201d\u200bIt was fortunate for us that the activity in the square monopolised the attention of boththe living and the dead. We did not have the strength to do anything but shuffle, by thequickest, shortest route, to the mouth of the Strand. We kept as close to the buildings onthe perimeter as we could; once we had to duck inside the shell of a blackened, frost-blown church as something on silver legs passed by. Otherwise, we were undisturbed.Soon we stood on the steps outside Fittes House, with mists and desolation stretchingeither side.  \u200bAnd it was the place, all right. There was no room for doubt. The frost on the stepshad been worn away by the passage of many feet, and a silver net hung suspended in theopen door to keep the wandering dead at bay. It hung there like a portcullis, or a range ofjagged teeth. Above it, the bones of the building rose many storeys to merge with theblack sky.\u200b\u201cGot to risk it,\u201d Lockwood croaked. \u201cWe might meet someone coming in or out, butwe can\u2019t help that now.

Here, disconcertingly, the nine trapped spirits stood, faint andflickering. They watched us avidly as we passed, rotating to keep pace with us. Pin-pricksof light burned in their hollow eyes. Long Hugh Henratty, the highwayman whose ghosthad been one of the first captured by Marissa and Tom Rotwell, grinned lopsidedly abovehis broken neck. The Clapham Butcher Boy made urgent motions with his spectral knife.Fortunately the silver-glass pillars on the other side held firm.All nine called out to us in soft voices, hooting and crying like owls. The words werenot pleasant. I\u2019m used to such stuff, but it disturbed the others more than me, for to theirsurprise they found they could hear them too.We left the room in haste, and so came to the Hall of Dead Heroes, where lift shaftsaccessed other floors. In our world, lavender fires burned perpetually here beside theshrines to fallen agents. There were no shrines here, just a black void. The three shaftswere likewise gaping holes, filled with mist.

Stay strong. We\u2019re almostthere.\u201d\u200bDown we went, flight after flight; and the lanterns led us ever deeper into the earth.We went very slowly now, past openings to unknown levels. On the third floor down, wesaw a light coming towards us through the dark.\u200b\u201cQuick! Off the steps!\u201d Lockwood pulled us back into a side room, its mouth part-filled with rubble; here we crouched, as far back as we dared, watching as the globe oflight drew nearer along a passage, and burned the mouth of the stairs into drab, grey life.  \u200bIt was two tall figures walking side by side. We watched them as in a dream. Theyhad their heads bent, close together; there was the murmur of conversation. The first worea silver cloak with a sweeping hood. Her long dark hair was pulled back almost out ofsight, but the graceful lines of the face were clear enough. It was the woman we knew asboth Penelope and Marissa, and she was laughing at something her companion said.This other person was a fair-haired young man, very tall and handsome. He wore akind of shimmering robe, which somehow reminded me of the negligible dresses LaBelle Dame had once been prone to wear: glitzy, glamorous, and not at all extensive. Itssole purpose seemed to be to highlight the impressive muscle tones of the young man\u2019storso, his athletic arms and legs, the swaying way his body moved. He had an exquisite beauty, and you could tell all this because he lacked both cloak and silver tunic. Hewalked through the dark and frozen world without protection, and a faintly goldenradiance hung about him. Indeed it was this light that we\u2019d seen from afar.The woman strode to the head of the stairs and was just taking the flight down whenthe young man touched her arm. He stood there, gazing all about him.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Penelope (or Marissa) said.\u201cI smell something living.\u201d The young man cocked his head; he wrinkled his elegantnose.\u201cIt\u2019ll be the night crew.

It was more than that. Itwas a bridge, a checkpoint, a high-road for the living to pass through. George had beenright. Lockwood\u2019s parents had been right. For years, hidden here, in this basement belowFittes House in the centre of London, there had been a permanent route between ourworld and the Other Side.It was a large room, lit by lanterns, and in the centre of it was a pit. The pit wascircular in shape and very broad, and it had a low wall built right around it. This wall,about the height of my knee, was made of solid iron. Thus, at a stroke, the Fittes agencyhad dispensed with the hassle and impermanence of iron chains. Although the precisecontents of the pit could not be seen, I knew it was stuffed with Sources, because thatfamiliar column of hazy light rose above it, packed with trapped and rushing spirit forms.To cross the pit, the designers hadn\u2019t bothered with small-time stuff like hangingchains, as Rotwell (and we) had done. Instead, an iron walkway or bridge \u2013 thin, but verysolid \u2013 surmounted the wall and spanned the centre of the pit, before disappearing intothe swirling haze. I couldn\u2019t see to the far side, but I knew that if we passed through it,we would be back in the living world.The others were waiting for me at the entrance to the bridge. I could scarcelyrecognise them beneath their crusted, steaming capes. Forget the spirits whirling in the pitbehind us.

He let the feathers drop back into position.He nodded once, very slowly, as if to himself. He didn\u2019t look at me.\u201cWell,\u201d he said.\u201cOh, Quill\u2026\u201d\u201cTypical.

You don\u2019t see straight; everysense is shrieking with the sudden onslaught of light and sound, with the feel of warm airon your skin and in your lungs; your body goes into a kind of temporary shutdown andmuscular collapse. This is particularly marked when you\u2019ve been over for a long time, aswe had, and it\u2019s not a condition that makes it easy to follow what\u2019s going on.\u200bGrief\u2019s similar. Sudden, unexpected grief all the more so. So don\u2019t ask me to piecetogether the fragments I\u2019ve retained: Lockwood dragging Kipps and me bodily clear ofthe circle; Lockwood bent over Kipps; Holly holding his hand; everyone bent over him,talking, talking to him (even I did, although what the point of that was, I don\u2019t know,because I knew he\u2019d gone, and I\u2019d already said everything that was to be said on theOther Side). Holly speaking to me, holding my face in her hands; me answering, staringright through her. Lockwood, covering Kipps with our discarded cloaks (we\u2019d torn themoff, I guess; at least, we were no longer wearing them). George just sitting there, his facestricken, the melting ice dripping from his spectacles like tears.\u200bAnd Lockwood, who was the first of us to rise to his feet. Lockwood, pulling hisrapier from his belt and tapping it gently on the floor so that the last of the frost fell fromit and the blade shone bright and new. Lockwood, putting his sword back in its place,then standing silent, patient, hand on hilt, waiting for us to recover.It took a while. What a mess we were, all feathers and fur and snot and melted ice,our faces blue, our eyes puffed and red. What a pointed contrast with the orderly room inwhich we found ourselves. Okay, sure, it had a massive ghostly maelstrom at its heart,but all that whirring chaos was nicely contained within the iron circle. Once across thebridge, as we were now, you found a brightly lit and white-washed room with all thesterile neatness of an operations room in a hospital.

Brrr\u2026 Now I\u2019m theone getting spooked by you.\u201d\u200bI leaned against the table. \u201cYou were right about Kipps,\u201d I said. \u201cHe\u2019s gone.\u201dThe face in the jar nodded. \u201cYeah. I know. I saw him pass through here just a minuteago.\u201d\u201cYou saw him?\u201d I stared round the laboratory, at the humming generators, theglistening cylinders, the antiseptic walls. It was a room that had no shadows, and noprospect of one. There was nowhere that a ghost might hide.\u201cOh, he\u2019 s not here now,\u201d the face said. \u201cI saw him on the Other Side. He passedthrough, as I say; pegged it up those icy stairs and gone. He wasn\u2019t hanging around; hehad somewhere that he needed to be. No dawdling near a dirty old Source for him.\u201d For amoment the ichor in the jar drew back and I saw the skull grinning at me. \u201cHe looked allright, you know,\u201d the ghost added. \u201cYou needn\u2019t worry.\u201dI said nothing.\u201cPersonally I think he was just glad to get shot of those stupid feathers before he died.Can you imagine having to wear them for all eternity?\u201d The plasm fizzed back into thesemblance of a face. \u201cAnyway, moving on\u2026 what super adventures are we having next?\u201dI made no attempt to answer, but picked up the jar. It was all I could do to carry it. Mystrength had not yet come back, and my legs felt wobbly as I walked. But before I couldreturn to the room with the Gate, Lockwood and the others came through the arch to joinme.No, not all the others, of course.

That was all the reassurance I couldoffer them. There was nothing else to say. The door to the silver lift was identical to the one in the Hall of Heroes, four floors aboveus. It was inscribed with the Fittes emblem: a noble unicorn, rampant, holding a lantern inits hoof. The metal had been polished until it shone. There was a tortoiseshell button onthe wall, and a floor dial overhead, showing numbers from -4 to 7. Right now the arrowpointed to 7, the penthouse floor. That was where we were going. Lockwood pressed thebutton; from somewhere came a faint, smooth hum, as distant mechanisms eased intoaction. We waited, gazing at the door. From behind us came Holly and George\u2019s softvoices as they rifled the weapons in the armoury.\u200bThe arrow flicked anti-clockwise back across the dial; the whirring sound grewlouder.

I checked my sword; the Velcro clasp had deteriorated on the Other Side, but Ithought it would just hold. The hammer was still there, and a couple of packets of ironfilings.

We watched the dial.\u201cHere\u2019 s my theory,\u201d the skull said. \u201cLucy keeps her chatting; while the old girl\u2019 sdistracted, Lockwood shimmies over and stabs her with a letter-opener off her desk.Sneaky, but effective.

Okay, my last offer. You both strip naked, daub charcoal on yourcheeks \u2013 and I\u2019m not specifying which ones \u2013 and rush out of the lift, whooping andshrieking, before hacking her to pieces with your swords. Yeah \u2013 on reflection, I thinkthat\u2019 s the strategy for you.\u201dWe watched the dial. The arrow pointed to the fourth floor.The face looked from Lockwood to me and back again. \u201cYou have got a plan, Isuppose?\u201d\u200bThe fifth\u2026 the sixth\u2026 You could hear the mechanism slowing.\u200bI swallowed. Lockwood took a deep, slow breath.\u200bTing! The bell rang cheerfully to tell us we were there. The lift stopped with scarcelythe slightest judder.Neither of us turned our heads, but our eyes met in the mirror. We drew our swords.\u200bThe door eased open. It would have suited the moment if we\u2019d at once had a clear view up some kind of sinisterthrone room with a red carpet in the middle, and bowing flunkies and ranks of gibberingghosts watching on either side. In actuality all we got was a small vestibule, or waitingroom, with a couple of chairs in it, and some nondescript modern art on the wall. To ourright, however, were two double doors. Lockwood pushed one open. A bright andcheerful light issued from inside, along with the sound of classical music playing. Therewas the heady scent of flowers. Lockwood and I tightened our grips on our rapiers andslipped inside.\u200bAnd then? No thrones. No flunkies. In fact the room beyond wasn\u2019t sinister at all,though it was imposing in a senior management sort of way, being the kind of place thatchief executives entertained clients before signing important deals. It was a broad,rectangular space, with a deep white carpet, and low-backed sofas ranged against thewalls. They looked angular, modish and uncomfortably fashionable. Each had glasscoffee tables beside them, scattered with books and magazines.At the far end of the room was a desk, and a wide, deep window that looked out overthe Thames and London. It was night, as the skull had told us, and the river was a deepblack band running between the brightly jewelled banks.

Mirrors were what counted here.  Aside from all that glass, the main item of furniture was the great oak desk sat in frontof the window, piled high with books and papers, and with two jars of white lilies ateither end. It looked expensive and contemporary, the perfect place for a busy chiefexecutive to work. And in front of it, with her chair swivelled half towards us and onewhite elbow leaning casually on the desktop behind, was that chief executive herself.Ms Fittes seemed no more put out at our sudden appearance in her private chambersthan if we were old friends she\u2019d bumped into in the street. Without the hooded silvercape and boots, she was suddenly back in slick and elegant businessperson mode, with abottle-green knee-length dress and high-heeled shoes. Her long dark hair was doing thatflowing, full-bodied thing, all lush and loose and impeccably aligned \u2013 the sort of effectyou get (I\u2019m told) if you devote untold hours to grooming, instead of simply eating,sleeping and keeping yourself alive, which is how it works for me. I had a sudden clearperception of how important her beauty was for her, how tightly its maintenance kept herconstrained. The mirrors told their story. The windows opened out on London, but thewhole apartment reflected in on her.She sat at ease in her fashionable chair of leather and chrome, with one arm bentbehind her and the other draped casually across her lap. Her pale hand hung relaxed; abracelet of green stones dangled on her wrist. There were no weapons nearby and no oneelse in the room. She smiled at us and bid us enter.\u201cAnthony and Lucy,\u201d she said. \u201cHow pleasant it is to see you both. Come on over.You\u2019re too far away for me to see you, skulking at the door.\u201dSo deep and melodious was her voice, so calm was she in her smart, sophisticatedroom, that even then we hesitated, acutely conscious of our ruined clothes, our grimy,bloodied faces. I looked down at the pristine carpet, my blackened boots planted on them.On either side the mirrors coolly reflected our ragged forms, our drawn swords, our feral,vagrant air.\u201cCome over,\u201d Ms Fittes said again. \u201cThere are seats for visitors.\u201d With a flick of thefingertips she indicated two canvas armchairs near the desk. \u201cPlease don\u2019t be shy to usethem. I can always have them cleaned.\u201dWith that remark, our hesitation melted clean away. My teeth clamped tight together. Isqueezed my rage tight in a vice; cold and bitter fury trickled downwards through me,dripping across my heart. This would be for Kipps, this would be for George; this wouldbe for the city ranged behind the calm, complacent woman at the desk. The sensation wasnot dissimilar from that which had possessed me at the Orpheus Society. I almost lostcontrol. Shaking, I raised my sword and walked across the carpet towards her, Lockwoodat my side.\u201cCareful,\u201d the skull said in my ear. \u201cYou must feel it.\u201dYes. I did.

She didn\u2019t show any reaction. Perhaps her eyeswidened just a fraction; or maybe it was that something moved inside them, came close tothe surface to gaze at us.\u201cStrike me sideways,\u201d the skull said. \u201cShe\u2019 s surely not going to deny it now!\u201d\u200b\u201cMarissa?\u201d She gave a lazy smile. \u201cWhy do you call me that?\u201d\u201cBecause we know you\u2019re not Penelope,\u201d I said. \u201cYou see, we read your book.\u201d\u201cOccult Theories,\u201d Lockwood said. \u201cWell, actually George read it. Wading throughthe dull speculations of a raving lunatic isn\u2019t something Luce and I do too often. Georgeisn\u2019t fussy, though. He reads anything. He\u2019d read the memoir of a lavatory attendant if itwas propped against his cornflakes. He told us about your theories of immortality, howthe body might be endlessly replenished by spiritual matter drawn from the Other Side.\u201d\u201cOh, he read that, did he?\u201d the woman said. She tapped her fingers on her knee. \u201cYoustole the copy belonging to the Orpheus Society, I suppose.\u201d\u201cWell, you took George\u2019s copy from him,\u201d I retorted. \u201cWe owe you for that, too.\u201d\u201cI notice you don\u2019t deny your crime,\u201d Miss Fittes said. \u201cThis sounds like a matter forthe police. Let\u2019s see now: breaking and entering, theft, causing substantial damage \u2013 notto mention severely wounding several very important citizens\u2026 And now you break inhere and threaten me? Dear me, such a roster of iniquity! You\u2019re both in serious trouble.\u201dLockwood\u2019s smile narrowed. \u201cWhat\u2019s a bit of breaking and entering between friends?Everyone\u2019s at it, these days. Your friend Rupert Gale, for instance. Is he around, by theway? I\u2019ve got a strong desire to see him.\u201dThe woman swivelled her chair slightly; she indicated a telephone on the desk. \u201cHeand his men are downstairs right now, trying to deal with some rather inconvenientvisitors. I\u2019m expecting a call from him shortly. If he can\u2019t sort things out, I may have togo down and see to it myself.\u201dI could tell from Lockwood\u2019s expression that he badly wanted more informationabout this, to know whether she was referring to George and Holly. But all he said was:\u201cThe book isn\u2019t all we\u2019ve seen, Marissa. Far from it. There\u2019s the small matter of yourtomb just up the road.\u201dShe spun her chair back round, very slowly, her face hardening. \u201cPardon me?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cYour posh old tomb. Which you\u2019re not in. We met someone who was,though. Remember your doctor? What was his name, Lockwood?\u201d\u201cRoberts,\u201d he said. \u201cDr Neil Roberts. He was asking after you.\u201d\u201cHe was asking for you,\u201d I said. \u201cHe badly wants to be reunited with you again.\u201dFor a second, the woman\u2019s expression became as static as one of the old masks we\u2019donce had on our walls. Her hand twitched, making the green stones jangle at her wrist.Then she gathered herself. \u201cOh dear, poor Neil. Is he still there? And still angry?

Now, all at once, he was quite still. In the mirrors adozen Lockwoods stood frozen. He and the woman held each other\u2019s gaze. \u201cWhat do youknow about my parents?\u201d he said. The tip of the rapier edged up towards her neck.\u201cI know more than you do, I think,\u201d she said. \u201cI remember them quite well. You lookrather like your father, but it was your mother who gave you your impulsiveness andinsight. I was there when they gave their last lecture at the Orpheus Society. It was verygood.\u201d Her smiled broadened. \u201cToo good. That\u2019s why it was their last.\u201d  Just for a second, Lockwood didn\u2019t breathe. Then he laughed. \u201cOh, well then,\u201d hesaid. \u201cThat\u2019s easy. That settles it.\u201dHis arm shot forward; the point of his rapier was at the woman\u2019s throat.\u201cLockwood!\u201d I said. \u201cDon\u2019t.

The windows were closed. The doors were shut. Yet a strong breeze hadcarried across the room. It lifted the edges of papers on the desk, and riffled the corners ofthe magazines on the far table.My skin crawled. I\u2019d seen that effect before.I Listened. It was psychically very quiet, but it was the kind of quiet you get whensomething is about to pounce. Its stillness was the stillness of a mousetrap. It didn\u2019t foolme.Something somewhere was feeding off Lockwood\u2019s rage.\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I said again. \u201cCalm down.

I mean, how bad could it possibly be?\u201d   \u200b24. I pushed open the door. The first thing I noticed was that Marissa\u2019s bedroom \u2013 and it wasa bedroom: there was a double bed in the centre of it \u2013 was much colder than hermirrored office. My belt thermometer showed a drop of five degrees as I passed acrossthe threshold. It wasn\u2019t a particularly large space; there was a closet, a wardrobe, achaise-long, and a door opening on to a swish-looking en suite bathroom. The bed itselfwas made from some fashionable pale wood; it was fitted with red silk sheets, fat pillowsand a snow-white counterpane. A lantern burned on the table beside it, casting the rest ofthe room into dusky shadow. There were floor-length curtains pulled across the wall atone end; elsewhere, a deep window, similar to the one in the office, afforded another viewover the London night. I looked at the window. Tight closed. That wasn\u2019t why it was sochilly.\u200bI stood in the doorway, listening. Stillness\u2026 The coquettish voice had fallen silent,but I could sense something nearby, watching. I glanced back into the study. Lockwoodand the woman remained more or less as before. I saw Lockwood glancing anxiously inmy direction. I raised my rapier reassuringly, and stepped fully into the bedroom. Likethe office, it had a thick white carpet; my boots made no noise.The ghost-jar was weighing me down. I put it down on the bed, where it sat at anautical angle, and slowly scanned the room.\u201cNice bed,\u201d the skull remarked. \u201cShe sure likes to indulge herself.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not talking to you.\u201d I moved slowly across to the bathroom and pushed the doorfully open with the hilt of my sword.\u201cSpends too much time in front of mirrors, mind. Bickerstaff was the same. It\u2019 s notgood for you. My old mum said witches are born that way.\u201dThe bathroom was stuffed with racks of perfumes, soaps and lotions; in its hyper-clean way, it had something of a witch\u2019s workroom about it. I retreated back into thebedroom. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine you ever having had a mum,\u201d I said.\u201cNice old dear, she was.\u201d\u201cI find that hard to believe.\u201d I stood at the foot of the bed, seeking the source of thecold.

As in manyways we were.I took off the remains of my jacket and laid it carefully across the bolster of thechaise-long. It encumbered me. I wanted to be light on my feet, this final time. Ismoothed my hair back and took up my rapier again. I looked down at my frost-burnedboots, my skirt and torn leggings, my old jumper with the ghost\u2019s handprint on the side. Iglanced around for a mirror, but funnily enough, after all those looking-glasses in the firstroom, there were none here that I could see. This made me feel slightly sad. After thejourney through the dark city, and with whatever waited for me behind the curtain, Iwanted to briefly remind myself of who I was. Lucy Carlyle.The curtains were of dark red silk. They were of the same stuff as Marissa\u2019s sheetsand pillow-cases. From behind them, the merry, sing-song voice called my name.My feet made no sound on the soft carpet. Beyond the window, lights twinkled.London slept.I came to the drapes and drew them aside.\u201cSurprise,\u201d the voice said.I\u2019d expected something nasty. If you\u2019d asked me to guess, I\u2019d have predicted thatwhat I\u2019d find behind the curtains would be the Source of the beautiful, exquisite spiritthat had accompanied Marissa on the Other Side. It was evidently a Type Three of somekind; like the skull, it would need to have its Source nearby, somewhere close at hand. I\u2019dhave predicted another skull, perhaps, or something equally unpleasant. It stood to reasonit wouldn\u2019t be too pretty.I hadn\u2019t expected a whole body.It was standing upright on a sort of golden stand, supported along its length by goldenrods and screws and clamps that prevented sections of its black and shrivelled flesh fromfalling to the floor. Even so, it was in pretty ropey condition, starting with the head. Partof this was gone; the left eye, for starters, and most of the cheek, jaw and cranium on thatside. Elsewhere, a black and rubbery rind of skin still maintained the vestiges of a face.There were sprouts of long black hair, and a bony neck like that of a plucked turkey.Below that, the torso was in poor nick too, all dried and thin and twisted like one of thosehorrid roasted vegetable chips Holly preferred to honest crisps. The surface was hard andblack as cooled lava, and a couple of ribs were poking through splits in the skin. Thearms and legs were little more than bones encased in a loose and papery rind. In places,screws had been driven through them to keep them in position. The thing was pierced,fixed, hung and clamped. It was a parody of a body. It stood in a little alcove all of itsown, framed by the swaying drapes. The yellowed teeth grinned at me and the eye holereflected no light.\u200bNone of that was what threw me, though.\u200bIt was Marissa.\u200bI recognised what was left of her head. The beaky nose; the jaw and forehead; thesweep of dusty black hair. It was what I\u2019d have more or less expected to find in the cryptbelow the mausoleum, if everything had been natural and as it should be; if the deadstayed in their proper places and the living in theirs. It was Marissa.\u200b\u201cOh,\u201d the skull said, from behind me on the bed. It\u2019s voice sounded as hesitant as I\u2019dever heard it. \u201cThat\u2019s unexpected.\u201d\u200b\u201cI told you you\u2019d be surprised.\u201d\u200bThe spirit was standing by the window.

It raised one hand: air moved beside me. Thecounterpane was swept up from the bed, knocking the skull\u2019s jar to the floor. Thebedspread hung over me, hunched and crumpled, almost like a ghost itself; it swiped andfeinted at me, blocking the blows of my rapier, driving me back to the door.

Then the rush of air, and the buffets of thecounterpane were unceremoniously bowling me out back into the mirrored room, whereLockwood and the woman were waiting as before.I stumbled and scampered over to them, with the spirit flowing along behind. Back atthe bedroom door, the air died and the counterpane dropped to the floor.Lockwood\u2019s eyes flicked between the spirit and me. He still had his sword held ready,but I could see his uncertainty. In her chair, the woman smiled contentedly like a cat.\u200b\u201cWhat\u2019s happened, Luce? Are you okay?\u201dI came to a halt beside him; my voice was a whisper. \u201cLockwood, Marissa\u2019s in there.\u201d\u200b\u201cWhat? How can she be?\u201d\u200b\u201cI don\u2019t know.

For the first time, she abandoned her originalposture and sat upright, in a businesslike manner. \u201cDear Anthony, you explained it all soprettily, earlier. And you\u2019ve discovered oh, so much. But as this little bitch will tell you,you haven\u2019t got it quite correct. Not quite. No \u2013 don\u2019t raise that sword near me again, ormy friend here will raise a spirit-wind that\u2019ll send you flying through that window.\u201d Shesat back in the chair. \u201cThank you. When we talked a few moments ago, you accused meof being Marissa, who had somehow rejuvenated her crabbed old body and turned it intothis.\u201d She looked down at herself with evident self-regard; in the mirrors a dozenreflections repeated the gesture. \u201cWell, miraculous as spirit essence is, there\u2019s no amountof it that can accomplish that miracle.\u201d\u200bThe radiant spirit moved closer; its power thrummed against us, fixing us where westood. Lockwood was listening to the woman intently; even so, I could feel his mindracing, constantly assessing our weapons, our position, the options of attack and escape.\u201cHowever,\u201d the woman went on, \u201cyou were very close.\u201d She leaned towards us now,her hands folded on her knees. \u201cAs that pustule of a ghost says, I am Marissa Fittes. Butthat\u2019s only half the story. Yes, I\u2019m Marissa, but I\u2019m Penelope too. Watch and see.\u201dShe leaned close, and now a strange thing happened to her; it was like watching theface of a clay doll being stretched to the side by the motion of a giant thumb. Her nose,mouth, eyes and cheekbones \u2013 all her features, for a second, were smudged and distorted,as something started pulling clear of them. Then they snapped back into position, as asecond face began to break free alongside. Two faces \u2013 one solid, the other faint and see-through! At first they were almost entirely superimposed upon each other, then simplyoverlapping; finally the translucent, ghostly head emerged like a midnight insect from achrysalis and hung independently beside the other. It was hard to say what was the moreterrible: the malevolent glimmer of intelligence in the eyes of the spirit, or the suddendeadness in the eyes of the living.Penelope\u2019s face hung slack and stupid, her breathing newly loud and ragged.

First I tried to snare the ectoplasm of theghosts in our world. That didn\u2019t work \u2013 as we all know, ordinary plasm harms the living.But on the Other Side, as I discovered, it is a different story \u2013 there a spirit\u2019s stuff is purerand more potent, and fragments of it may be captured by means of special nets.\u201dLockwood nodded. \u201cYes, we\u2019ve seen the crimes you work on the spirits too.\u201d\u201cCrimes?\u201d She spat the word back at us. \u201cThey\u2019re dead! They\u2019re gone! They wanderstupidly in the dark. We owe them nothing.\u201dI thought of Kipps, then. I thought of the dark roads he was wandering now. I staredat her, hot-eyed.\u201cIf treated carefully,\u201d Marissa said, \u201cif processed in subtle ways, this spirit substancecan be made palatable to the living. It can be absorbed, and has the effect ofstrengthening our own souls, of prolonging life. In all this, my dear companion showedme the way.\u201d She smiled up at the radiant spirit, but it had been distracted again by theghost in the jar, which was making a variety of abusive gestures in its direction. Marissaignored them both. \u201cAh, but you have no idea how much of it is required for the slightestbenefit!\u201d she went on. \u201cAnd there were significant drawbacks for me, because I wasmaking too many journeys to the Other Side. My protective clothes were not sufficient.With each journey, though my spirit grew stronger, but my body aged. You bothunderstand that,\u201d she added. \u201cI see you\u2019ve both got a few grey hairs \u2013 you\u2019d have acouple more after today, I don\u2019t doubt. Anyway, it was not long before I began to growold before my time.\u201d\u201cAnd how,\u201d I said. I turned to Lockwood. \u201cThat body in the bedroom? Yeuch.\u201dHe raised an eyebrow. \u201cShe\u2019s no looker, then?\u201d\u201cRemember that wet corpse we found wedged under Lovell\u2019s Wharf? Worse.\u201d\u201cGood Lord.\u201dMarissa Fittes coughed slightly. \u201cIf I might continue? I needed the help of others toproceed, and my friends at the Orpheus Society have proved most reliable over manyyears. As you correctly state, they are driven by the same dreams as me, and to this daythey fund many of the experiments going on downstairs.\u201d She smiled at us; it was a thinsmile, without empathy. \u201cThey are old and rich and growing desperate. They eke out theirtime, extending it little by little\u2026 it is a losing battle for them. But I \u2013 I have discoveredthe better answer.\u201d\u201cLeave your body altogether,\u201d Lockwood said. \u201cUse someone else\u2019s. Nice.\u201d\u201cWhat alternative was there? My spirit had grown very strong \u2013 you would notbelieve how strong it is! \u2013 but the body was worn out. At last I lay near death, survivingonly by pure will. The doctor who tended to me was a fool. He would have had mecoffined up and buried! Instead, we arranged for him to occupy the tomb, while I soughtrefuge in a living vessel. My daughter was first, but Mary was weak in mind and body. Ididn\u2019t find her a good fit at all. Fortunately my dear grand-daughter Penelope is muchmore robust. I can see us having a partnership for a good many years. And now,\u201d MarissaFittes said, \u201cwhat else is there to say?

A frond of dark hair hung over one eye. \u201cYes, Anthony, do you know, I am,\u201dshe said, \u201cand I have to blame you for them, don\u2019t I?\u201dLockwood raised a modest hand. \u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t want to take all the credit \u2013 butthat\u2019s pretty much the way of it, yes.\u201dShe nodded. \u201cI thought so.\u201d She stepped across to stand beside her spirit advisor, andits radiance swelled to encompass her. For some reason I was reminded of the way LaBelle Dame\u2019s head had sought to reattach itself to her body, those last few moments onthe stage. They were inextricably linked together, Marissa and this spirit. How manyyears had it been there, infesting her thoughts and dreams? How long had she willinglylain to sleep in the next room, with it close enough to touch? There was no silver-glasscase, no iron, no lavender here \u2013 nothing to hem it in. This was its room, as much asMarissa\u2019s \u2013 perhaps more so. They stood the two of them, gazing at us. It was the end.\u201cI thought so, Anthony,\u201d Marissa said again, very slowly and distinctly. She glancedat her companion. \u201cWhich is why we\u2019re going to kill you now.\u201d  \u200b25. And Lockwood moved. He had been readying himself for it ever since I\u2019d returned to theroom. He\u2019d known it would come to this. At some point during the conversation, he haddecided on his course of action; now, almost before Marissa had finished speaking, heacted. No hesitation, no delay: the leap was faster than thought. Marissa and the spiritwere taken entirely unawares. Perhaps even now they underestimated him, taken in byoutward appearances \u2013 by his wounds and ragged clothes. Perhaps Marissa, in hercomplacency and self-regard, had assumed the matter dealt with, and was alreadythinking of the problems she faced downstairs. Perhaps the spirit was also distracted \u2013 ithad been growing increasingly enraged by the rude faces the skull was making at it frombehind its glass. Or perhaps Lockwood, as so often, was simply quicker than everyonearound him. That\u2019s what I like to believe. He remained one step ahead of everybody, rightto the last.\u200bIt also helped that he did the opposite of what our enemies expected. He didn\u2019t run.He didn\u2019t try a long-distance assault with canister or flare. Instead he jumped directly atMarissa and the spirit. It was a full frontal attack, and the spirit was the main target.Before his feet had landed on the carpet again, Lockwood\u2019s rapier had swung round andsliced straight through the waist of that preening, glowing young man, curling up andoutwards again with dregs of ectoplasm pouring from the blade. Lockwood continued hisspin; crouching, he twirled right round, coat swirling like the tail of a black bedraggledbird, and struck out at Marissa, catching her on one arm and sending her backwards, witha scream, to tumble between her desk and chair. Only then did he pause: he came to astandstill facing the ghost, where its severed parts still hung startled in the air, his swordheld ready for a second blow.\u200bAll this before I\u2019d even started on my run for the lifts.It didn\u2019t help that all my instincts were to stay with Lockwood and join the fight. Buthe\u2019d given me my orders, and I wasn\u2019t going to betray him now. I snatched up the ghost-jar and pelted away across the office.

The point of one especially long fragmentjabbed right through the sofa back, just above my ear. The barrage ended. Glass piecesdropped into the carpet. I could hear Marissa\u2019s footsteps crunching through them, and thesoft swishing of the ghost\u2019s robes.\u200bThe skull\u2019s ghost-jar had spilled out of my hands and was lying horizontally next tome, the face gazing into mine.

My fingers were wet with blood, andthe handle slipped through them. I caught hold and drew it out.Already it was almost too late.\u200bThe sofa moved in front of me. Slowly at first \u2013 all at once a powerful psychic forceenfolded it, and it was suddenly swept aside. Ghost fog beat against me in a froth. Whenit settled back I was sitting against the wall, gazing up at my enemies with the ghost-jar inmy lap and the hammer in my hand.In some ways it was hard to know which of them was living and which was dead.They were very close together. Marissa Fittes\u2019s dark dress shimmered with other-lightthat extended from the figure at her side. Her face was ghastly with it. Her outline waswreathed in tendrils of ghost fog, making it curiously insubstantial. By contrast the ghostbeside her, radiant and smiling, seemed almost solid, fizzing with energy.\u200b\u201cPoor Lucy,\u201d Marissa said.\u200bAnd I suppose I did look pretty poor right then. I was lying in my own blood. I hadmy hair over my eyes. My clothes were torn and dirty\u2014 Hey, you know the rest. I gazedup at them through narrowed eyes.\u201cAren\u2019t you going to beg?\u201d Marissa asked.

There was a slight chip in the glass, but otherwiseall was as before.\u200b\u201cSorry, were you trying to do something there?\u201d Marissa asked.\u200bThe ghost in the jar had been braced as if for mighty impact.

I lifted the hammer; I struck andstruck at the jar, blind in my desperation and hate, little caring that the shining spirit wasreaching out for me, pale hands about to grasp my neck.\u200bLockwood\u2026There was a crack. Still I struck and struck.\u200b\u201cOi! Careful! You could smash a skull, going like that.\u201d The voice came from aboveme. I was no longer alone. A thin grey youth with spiky hair stood close beside me. WhenI looked down, I saw that one side of the jar had caved in; pale green ichor spilled outfrom the cracks, floating like mist in the air around me. Below the spears of broken glass,an old skull grinned up from the base of the jar.\u200bMarissa\u2019s companion had backed off a little. Marissa, sensing this, retreated too.\u200b\u201cThat\u2019 s much better,\u201d the youth said. It put its hands together and cracked itsknuckles. \u201cNow we can all get properly acquainted.\u201d\u200bIt pointed a finger; a spirit-wind rushed outwards, carrying Marissa off her feet,sending her tumbling back across the room like a broken doll. She knocked heavilyagainst the opposite wall and lay there.\u200b\u201cOoh,\u201d the grey youth said. \u201cSore! I felt that. Now then\u2026 what about you?\u201d\u200bIt glared at the radiant young man, who hovered a few yards distant. The wind hadpassed right through it, without disturbing so much as a well coifed hair on its head. Icould feel the ferocity of its attention, saw its hand raise as if to reply in kind\u2014 Then,without warning, it flowed backwards across the room and took up a station close towhere Marissa lay.\u201cVery wise,\u201d the youth said grimly. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t protect her, he knows I\u2019ll snap herneck like a twig. Now, you\u2019ve got a few moments to scarper. She\u2019ll wake up soon.\u201d\u200bI got unsteadily to my feet. After a moment\u2019s hesitation, I picked up the broken jar. \u200b\u201cThank you,\u201d I said. I stumbled back across the room.The youth gave a groan. \u201cNo! The lift\u2019 s that way!

The window gaped ahead of me, filled with thelights and the night\u2019s soft darkness, and the seven-storey drop towards the mud-banks ofthe river below. My heart caught in my throat. I craned my head over\u2014And saw Lockwood just below me, hanging on to a lip of stone below the sill. Hishair was swept back, his face stricken with the effort of clinging on.

The spirit saw us: cold, malevolent fingers of air probed in ourdirection, but were counteracted by flurries coming from the youth. I heard Marissa givea cry of rage. Then we were out and into the vestibule, where the lift stood open andready. We bundled inside, gasping. I stabbed the ground-floor button. Slowly, slowly, thedoor began to close.There was an almighty bang inside the room. It sounded like the ceiling had comedown. A cloud of dust and debris spilled out into the vestibule \u2013 and with it came a shapethat flowed swiftly through the doors, across the vestibule and into the lift, just as thedoor shut fast. The grey youth slouched to a halt.

The only other times I\u2019dseen it in its proper shape had been on the Other Side, when its silver-glass prison hadmade it faint and dim. Now the details were clearer, and it had to be said they weren\u2019t tooprepossessing. It turned out the owner of the skull had been a rangy, almost scrawnyyouth, with amused, rather shifty-looking eyes and the remnants of a bad case of acne.His hair was short, but hacked about as if he\u2019d done it himself. He wore a tatty white shirtand grey trousers that were slightly too short for him. His feet were bare. He looked in hislate teens. He hadn\u2019t been too old when he died.  Lockwood had also been studying him. He gathered his breath, looked at the spiritlevelly. \u201cThanks,\u201d he said.\u201cOh, I did it for Lucy, not you.\u201dLockwood couldn\u2019t hear him; he\u2019d already turned to me. \u201cI thought I told you to getout back there,\u201d he said. \u201cI told you not to hang around.\u201dI stood upright, smoothed my hair out of my eyes. \u201cYou were the one hanging around.By your fingertips from a window.

We\u2019d known something was up on the ground floor of Fittes House, but until thatmoment neither Lockwood nor I had had the leisure to guess precisely what. We knew itwas big. We knew Marissa wasn\u2019t happy about it. We could guess that our friends werethoroughly involved. But it wasn\u2019t until a plume of pungent lavender smoke camesurging through into the lift, and we saw the body of the DEPRAC agent lying justoutside the doors that we began to truly grasp its scale. The air rang with the sound ofyells and clashing swords. Away in the smoke, across the Hall of Dead Heroes, weglimpsed frantically running forms. The burning braziers at the shrines opposite had beentoppled and hot embers strewn across the marble floor. Behind it all, a loud psychicconcussion beat at our heads; I heard ghosts\u2019 voices howling.\u200bWe stepped out of the lift, swords in hand, then jerked aside as a man in a Fittesuniform erupted from the smoke and ran past us, screaming.

Most of the screams were coming from the doorthat led towards the front of the building and the Hall of Pillars. As we started off, an oddnoise sounded behind us: the thud of something landing on the top of the lift car.We looked at each other. Lockwood clenched his teeth. \u201cShe can wait her turn.Besides, it\u2019s going to take her a few minutes to break through the roof. Come on.\u201dWe weren\u2019t experts on the layout of the Fittes building, and the passages were filledwith magnesium smoke; it was a disorientating and tentative progress, made worse by thepsychic pandemonium happening somewhere nearby. We didn\u2019t go the shortest way. Myside was numb, and it wasn\u2019t easy to walk, but I didn\u2019t want Lockwood to see it. Ifollowed him as quickly as I could, the Skull\u2019s spirit floating at my shoulder.\u201cSo,\u201d the Skull said after a while, \u201cwho do you want me to kill?\u201d\u200b\u201cI don\u2019t want you to kill anybody!

It did things biggerand more grandly than anywhere else, and this held true in its final haunting. Whether ithad been the initial explosions at the pillars that had blown the chandeliers, or whetherthe psychic energies thus released had interfered with the electrics, the hall was now aplace of deep, blue shadow. Magnesium smoke hung in seeping layers in the air. Orangeradiance from the ghost-lights in the Strand showed through the windows, illuminatingthe nine broken pillars in the centre of the room. Some were shattered, split right through;others more or less held their shape, their surface riven with cracks. In each case, it hadbeen enough to release the spirit contained there, as nine shrieking spheres of other-lightamply demonstrated. They moved separately across the marble floor, some rushing, somewith more stately or painful tread. In the heart of each was a shape corresponding to oneghost type or other. There near the window a Dark Spectre, possibly manifesting from theinfamous Frank Street Coffin, stretched out long tendrils of blackness. There the sinewytranslucent shape of Long Hugh Henratty, the Mud Lane Phantom, stalked as if on tiptoeon its severed ankle bones. There the Gory Girl of Cumberland Place crawled along inher weltered nightdress\u2026 And so it went. The Morden Poltergeist had escaped its teapot;it had no discernable form, but had caught up the fragments of its pillar and was whirlingthem about in an upturned cone of shattered glass.\u200bNone of the Visitors could pull too far from their Sources, which remained clampedin the ruined pillars; perhaps the proximity of all that silver-glass still weakened them.Even so, they exulted in their freedom \u2013 my head rang with their cries.\u201cMy God,\u201d I said. \u201cThe", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3301, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e4509910-af89-4ef5-a195-da31dcf9d4ec": {"__data__": {"id_": "e4509910-af89-4ef5-a195-da31dcf9d4ec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "144", "file_name": "Lockwood-V-The-Empty-Grave-First-Draft.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c05ac8e2-cea7-4a49-a654-29f8f62b86e3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "144", "file_name": "Lockwood-V-The-Empty-Grave-First-Draft.pdf"}, "hash": "7710b4d6c82047e46445fca8fb6af9280ba4a9699632add84cc3dd59fa864190"}, "2": {"node_id": "18e81916-b4c2-43ef-b13a-2a1f8da15c7f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "144", "file_name": "Lockwood-V-The-Empty-Grave-First-Draft.pdf"}, "hash": "28155571520a372ca8ec2b8a78c5d43cd2970905107be969526c1b4adf9ff693"}}, "hash": "060a4613d56806038bd535f706daa06e938f32ee9930908255a5f02a49ebca76", "text": "head rang with their cries.\u201cMy God,\u201d I said. \u201cThe noise\u2026\u201d\u201cBit showy,\u201d the Skull said. \u201cAll that hooting and cackling.

With thedarkness and the eerie other-light it was hard to see what else was in the room. Thebodies of several men and women lay scattered about, DEPRAC officers and members ofthe Fittes militia. Some lay in pools of blood; others, the victims of ghost-touch, werealready swollen and blue. But there was movement in the shadows and, I thought, thesound of rapiers. And since Barnes and his men were behind us, that only meant onething.We began to run \u2013 Lockwood swiftly, me hobbling along.

Behindhim, Holly subsided, her rapier held limply between her fingers. She looked exhausted;she sank to her knees.It had to be said that Sir Rupert didn\u2019t look on top form either. His clothes were asdapper as ever: a grey-green jacket with black lapels, dark trousers, a vibrant yellow tie.But there was blood on his neck and knees. His eyes glittered in grey sockets; veins stoodout on his cheeks. When he spread his arms in welcome, an old strapping at his wristshowed the place where I\u2019d struck him in the bedroom more than twenty four hoursearlier. He smiled broadly at us, even so.\u201cAh, I\u2019m so pleased,\u201d he said. \u201cYou did make it, then.\u201dLockwood came to a halt, held his rapier at his side. He gestured around at thescreaming ghosts; by their eerie lights you could see the ruined pillars, the stuccoedceiling, the panels with their painted depictions of great events in the history of psychicaldetection. \u201cYes, I made it. Well, what do you think? This a glamorous enough spot foryou?\u201d\u200bSir Rupert grinned. \u201cI\u2019ve no complaints this time.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine, then.\u201dThey raised their swords, touched them together. Lockwood brushed his hair out ofhis eyes. Then Sir Rupert sprang towards him.Three clashes, two feints, a side-step and a roll \u2013 already they were away across thehall, moving between the drifting tendrils of the Dark Spectre and the shuffling cadaverof poor Godel, weeping piteously for its missing arm. I forced myself to look away. Itwould be okay. I trusted him. I knew Lockwood and it would be fine. I knelt beside Hollyand George.Holly could barely raise her head to smile at me. George\u2019s face was blackened withsmoke, but I couldn\u2019t see any obvious injuries. His sword lay at his feet.

Just for me.\u201dShe didn\u2019t argue; she knew that they were spent. I left them hobbling together, arm inarm, following the glimmering shape of the spiky-haired youth. Left them, and turnedback to the sword fight in the hall.\u200bThey were moving back and forth between the pillars, Lockwood and Sir RupertGale, their reflections skipping across the fractured surfaces, swelling and shrinking,distorting on the jags of broken glass. Spectral shapes threw themselves towards them,mouthing shrieks and curses. Sometimes the whirling iron deterred the ghosts; othertimes the combatants simply swerved away. They made no sound but the scuff andsqueak and shuffle of their boots on the shining marble floor. In and out, foot to foot,twisting and spinning in a single synchronised flow. It was a ballet as much as a fight,with beauty as well as terror. It was a dance of death with two possible ends.\u200bWithin that dance, all weariness and injury had gone, all bodily weaknesses leftbehind. A while ago, Lockwood had been scarcely able to move, but you wouldn\u2019t haveguessed that from his airy steps, they way he swung out of reach of the swiftest blows.Sir Rupert also; he\u2019d looked half-dead when he\u2019d turned to us. Yet now, from some deepwell of defiance and hatred, he had summoned renewed strength, and moved with themost light-footed grace. Neither of them spoke; the illusion was too fragile, theconcentration required to sustain it too great. One word, one mistake, and everythingwould fall away; the mask would slip and a life be lost.  \u201cGhost-touch would be so much simpler,\u201d the Skull said. Its spirit had returned; ithovered beside me, arms folded, tapping a translucent finger on its sleeve.\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cAre you sure I can\u2019t just\u2014 Oh, too late.\u201dI followed its gaze. Marissa Fittes was walking towards us across the hall.Her stolen body still seemed to be functioning well. Penelope\u2019s long hair flapped inthe breeze that blew about her, her heels clicked purposefully on the marble floor. Herspirit companion was close behind, radiant and beautiful as ever, its drapes of swirlingother-light coiling round her in a loving gesture of support. Marissa was carryingsomething strapped over her shoulder: a metal cylinder of some kind. I was instantlyreminded of the weaponry the Orpheus members had used, but the woman didn\u2019t seek touse it. She came to a halt a few metres from me and signalled to her companion.A snapped section of one of the pillars lay near them on the floor, jagged with spursof broken glass. The ghost\u2019s arm swept round, and the pillar span with it, whipping acrossthe floor towards me. At my side the scrawny youth made a similar gesture. The pillar\u2019smomentum slowed; it reversed its spin and shot back towards Marissa. The golden spiritmoved its arm; the pillar swung aside, rolled straight through the Gory Girl\u2019s crawlingform, and smashed against the wall.The golden spirit frowned. A storm of air raged round me, met an answering windfrom the youth beside me and fell back.\u201cThis is fun,\u201d the Skull said. \u201cBeen ages since I\u2019ve had the chance to do anything likethis.

That lovely face didn\u2019t look so good now that certaintyhad gone; somehow its perfect lines no longer aligned; the cheekbones seemed too high,the chin too protuberant. Complacency had glued the mask in position over the years;without it, there was an ugliness coming through.\u201cGet away from me!\u201d She picked up a piece of silver-glass, a fragment of one of thepillars.

I took my chance \u2013 leaping forward, I seized her arm and,with the tip of the rapier, slashed the jade bracelet from her wrist, severing its soft goldband. A violent psychic charge ran through me; I almost dropped the sword. Away acrossthe hall, her spirit companion gave a plangent cry. It turned from its confrontation withthe skull, and with glowing eyes rushed across towards me, robes flapping, mouthhideously agape. I scrabbled at my belt, pulled a silver-net from its pouch and wrapped itround the broken bracelet.

A faint blue glow of other-light expanded behind her; a smooth, roundface materialised at her back. The Clapham Butcher Boy was one of the slower andquieter of the nine released spirits; he had made no noise in his approach, and he made nonoise now as his great pale arms stole round Marissa and drew her to him. His slackmouth opened in welcome; his sightless eyes stared out at nothing. He was like a deep-sea fish swallowing its prey. He hugged her close, so that blue veins of ice ran swiftly upand down her skin. Her limbs jerked and thrashed; she made a gargling sound. Her handsclenched and spasmed, as she was drawn back into the dark. At her chest a little red lightshowed suddenly. There was a faintest whirring; a smell of oil and burning.I looked at Lockwood. \u201cWait. Did she\u2014?\u201dHis eyes were wide. \u201cYes.\u201dThe Skull\u2019s spirit stepped between us, that thin, ill-favoured youth, with his sidelongeyes and scratty hair. \u201cShe did, and there\u2019 s no point you running.

Two seconds.\u201d\u201cShe said we had ten\u2026\u201dHe grinned at me. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about that.\u201dThe youth lifted his arms. The spirit-wind that struck us forced all the air from mylungs. It sent us off our feet and straight out backwards across the hall.As we flew back I saw the explosion deeper in the hall, saw a boiling plume of blackand red expand outwards at blinding speed. It cut right through the broken pillars and theghosts. It cut through the figure of the youth as he watched us go. It accelerated after us,and the windows of the Hall of Pillars burst with the oncoming heat. But we were stillahead of it, Lockwood and I. We were going too fast. It could not catch us.

The Beginning\u200b27. It was fortunate that the original builders of Fittes House had not taken any shortcuts withits construction, because \u2013 despite Marissa\u2019s dire predictions \u2013 the explosion in the Hallof Pillars didn\u2019t make the whole thing fall down. Most of the destruction wasconcentrated in the ground floor area, with the main force of the blast being directedstreetwards through reception, blowing out part of the front wall, and sending glass andrubble spilling across the Strand. The famous glass doors, with their inscribed unicornmotifs, were utterly obliterated. One or two walls collapsed internally, as did part of theceiling above the Hall. All traces of the silver-glass pillars and the relics they containedwere at once wiped out.\u200bMore importantly, the explosion itself claimed few extra casualties. Since it happenedat five in the morning, the surrounding streets had been mostly deserted, and the pitchedbattle that had been going on inside the building for the previous few hours had led to theevacuation of ordinary Fittes staff. The remaining DEPRAC forces, under command ofMontagu Barnes, had also got clear by way of an underground tunnel leading to theThames. As dawn broke, such survivors gathered in the Strand. Smoke hung thickly overcentral London, and a large number of onlookers began to congregate in TrafalgarSquare.Inspector Barnes, whose raincoat had sustained significant damage in the battle, castthe tattered remnants aside and commandeered a leather biker\u2019s jacket from a bystanderin the street. For the next few hours he seemed to be everywhere, summoning ambulancesand medic-vans, regrouping his DEPRAC team, and rousing the dozens of wanderingFittes agents, who were mostly in a state of shock, to assist with crowd control. He alsorequisitioned two caf\u00e9s across the street to provide a constant stream of hot food anddrinks to all.The smoke cleared; the heat in the building died down. Search and rescue teams wentin. Almost at once, they discovered a number of white-coated scientists, wide-eyed andtremulous, who had appeared from the basement levels. They were at once handed intoDEPRAC custody. Two of Sir Rupert Gale\u2019s men, one suffering from ghost-touch, werealso located alive; they were taken off to hospital under armed guard.\u200bBy mid-morning, DEPRAC crews had cordoned off the end of the Strand, and thesituation was under full control. A census of survivors was taken, and a tentative list ofthe dead or missing formed. Bodies began to be brought out of Fittes House. Mostly thesewere ones that had been some way from the centre of the explosion. Those of Sir RupertGale and Penelope Fittes were not found. At some point during all this activity the surviving members of Lockwood & Co. went tosit at a window table in the Silver Unicorn caf\u00e9, directly opposite the disaster zone. Theemergency services had already taken us under their wing; our cuts had been cleaned,dressed and bandaged, and pep-shots of insulin given to us to counteract our closeexposure to ectoplasm. For each of us, a hospital visit had been offered and declined. Ihad been forced to protest particularly strongly to avoid this fate: the stab wound in myside was the most serious of our varied injuries, and an overnight stay was recommended.But I would not leave the others. In the end I was patched up, drugged and given atemporary discharge, with instructions to report to a doctor the next day. Then the medicsturfed me out. So I sat in the caf\u00e9 with the rest of them.\u200bThere isn\u2019t any point in describing in detail how we looked. We were just as bad asbefore, only now with added plasters and minor burns.

She looked precisely the same as she alwaysdid, down to the familiar stains on her puffer jacket and her mud-encrusted boots.

Didn\u2019t think you\u2019d makeit.\u201d\u200b\u201cWe didn\u2019t,\u201d Lockwood said. \u201cNot all of us.\u201d\u200b\u201cNo. Well.\u201d Flo glanced over at the caf\u00e9 door, where Inspector Barnes was loudlygiving orders to an officer behind him. \u201cLooks like it\u2019s maybe time to go.

He had one arm in a sling, protruding from beneath his leather jacket.Lockwood pulled himself higher in the chair, squared his shoulders and put on a fairattempt at his most gleaming smile. \u201cNice jacket, Mr Barnes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt suits you.\u201dThe Inspector regarded himself. \u201cYou know, I think it does. I might well keep it. So,you\u2019re all fed and watered then, I see.

The DEPRACcars didn\u2019t drop us back at the end of Portland Row until gone five. You could feel theonset of evening in the air, but the sky was still blue, and the rusted ghost-lamps were notyet buzzing into life. The momentous events in central London had yet to resonate here.Many of the houses had their doors and windows still open, and children were playing inthe pavements and the basement yards. The purple-blue splendour of the lavender bushespressing against the railings almost gave the street the feel of a formal garden. At gatesand porches, beneath twinkling silvery defences, neighbours discussed the events of theday. Old Arif, standing outside his General Stores, was tipping last night\u2019s lavender ashout of his street brazier, before readying another fire. His humming, the laughter of thechildren and the voices of the adults merged and mingled on the ear.We headed slowly, painfully, up the road.The front of 35 Portland Row didn\u2019t look too bad. Apart from the magnesium stainson the path, the brightly coloured DEPRAC tape wound messily across the gate, and theContaminated Zone warning signs plastered on the old black door you might almost havethought nothing had happened there.Lockwood pulled the tape off the gate, crumpled it into a sticky ball and cast it aside.He put his hand on the metal cross-piece, but didn\u2019t push it open.We stood outside in the street looking up at the house.There wasn\u2019t much obvious external damage. Only one of the windows was broken.But we could see the remains of our boards over the inside of the basement windows, andthe ones upstairs looked dark and hollow.

THE ULTIMATE BETRAYAL  Occult experiments in heart of LondonPenelope Fittes involvement goes back yearsInside today: M U Barnes and A J Lockwood finally speak outExtraordinary developments continued yesterday in the Fittes House Scandal, a full weekafter explosions rocked central London, killing company head Penelope Fittes and manyothers, and leading to revelations that have turned the psychical defence industry upsidedown. With Fittes House itself still under quarantine, and many employees remainingunder arrest, DEPRAC officials have been slow to provide details either of the hiddenlaboratories discovered beneath the building or of the secret raid that brought them tolight. Now, in an exclusive interview with today\u2019 s Times of London, two heroes of theraid, Mr Montagu Barnes of DEPRAC and Mr Anthony Lockwood of the Lockwood &Co. agency, set the record straight.\u200b\u201cIn the basement levels of Fittes House,\u201d Mr Lockwood says, \u201cwe discoveredevidence of unnatural occult experiments using forbidden psychic relics. Stockpiles ofillegal explosives were also found, some of which were set off in the fighting that followedour arrival. Many brave DEPRAC agents lost their lives when the criminals attacked.And Lockwood & Co. is mourning the death of our most valued friend, Mr Quill Kipps.Without Quill, none of this would have been uncovered. I\u2019d like to pay tribute to him.\u201d\u200bAccording to Mr Barnes, the scale of the occult activity was enough to threateneveryone in London, and possibly further afield. \u201cWe are investigating the nature of thesewicked experiments and will continue to do so. There\u2019 s no question however thatPenelope Fittes was orchestrating them, and had been for many years. It\u2019 s a grievousbetrayal of everything her grandmother stood for. Marissa Fittes will be turning in hergrave.\u201dSeveral close associates of Ms Fittes, at the Sunrise Corporation and other majoragency supply companies, have also been arrested. DEPRAC emphasises, however, thatthe public need not fear a breakdown in our national paranormal defences. The Fittesand Rotwell agencies are being reconstituted as the United Agency, under the temporarycontrol of Mr Barnes. \u201cRest assured,\u201d he says, \u201cthat this scandal, shocking though it is,will not deter psychical investigations agencies, big and small, from continuing to serveyou in our ongoing battle with the Problem.\u201dFull Barnes and Lockwood Interview: see page 3-6Decline and Fall \u2013 the Story of the Fittes Dynasty: see pages 8-11Mr Quill Kipps \u2013 Memories of an Unsung Hero: see page 16 \u201cWhat amazes me, Lockwood,\u201d I said, looking at him over the top of the newspaper, \u201cishow much you manage to say here, and how little. You and Barnes are as bad as eachother now. I\u2019m surprised you\u2019re not growing a little bog-brush moustache.\u201d\u200bLockwood was sitting with his elbow resting on the kitchen table, luxuriating in apatch of morning sun. He had on a new white shirt, and since it was a new whitetablecloth too, on a nice new table, on a sunny morning, the effect was almost enough tomake you shield your eyes. He smiled ruefully. \u201cI know what you mean, Luce.

No more visits toDEPRAC, no more media and no more newspaper interviews. Bliss! No need for me tosay anything to anybody.\u201d\u200bI shrugged. \u201cYeah. Like you ever actually said anything at all.\u201d\u200bHe smiled at me behind the steam. \u201cYou know perfectly well Barnes is correct, Lucy.If people knew the Problem was probably caused by the first psychic detection agents, ifthey discovered that the heads of many top companies were complicit in what Marissahad been doing, what would they do? I\u2019ll tell you. They\u2019d rise up and tear us all to pieces!There\u2019d be anarchy. Society would fall apart. And all for what end? It still wouldn\u2019t havesolved the Problem.\u201d\u200bWe\u2019d discussed this all before and I had some counterarguments ready, but at thatmoment George came in from the hall, bringing with him a strong smell of paint. Like allof us, his bruises were beginning to fade, but his beating still affected him, and he walkedmore slowly than usual. He had on the new pair of glasses he\u2019d got that week, slightlysmaller and less round than his previous pair. Even I had to admit they were almoststylish. Right now, however, their urbane effect was somewhat blunted by his enormous,paint-spattered set of dungarees.

So we\u2019d stripped the linoleum, and removed the broken cupboards. Thewindows had been replaced. A new back door, unpainted, awaited our attention. Our realpriority had been the table and its Thinking Cloth. With these in place, it was possible tofunction again. The house would be all right. Like us, it was taking time to heal.\u200bAnd it was a beautiful morning to be healing in. In the garden, the tree was dark andheavy with apples. The rings of burnt grass below the steps and outside the basementdoor were almost lost in the general greenness. Soon I would pick the apples \u2013 I wouldmake time for that this year \u2013 and reseed the lawns. We would repaint the windows andrepair our basement office. We would build new straw dummies and hang them in therapier room. We would restock our shelves and walls with books and curios. Newartefacts would be found (almost all of Lockwood\u2019s parents\u2019 collection had beensurrendered to the Gate in Jessica\u2019s room, and since removed by DEPRAC anddestroyed), and new furniture bought.

This was the way it had been since the day of theexplosion, when (ignoring Barnes\u2019s orders and the interventions of his team) I had madea brief foray across the Strand and found the remains of the ghost-jar wedged in a heap ofdebris near the ruined hall. The jar had been mangled and melted in the heat; the skull, however, though seared and cracked, had survived intact. I had pulled it clear, wrapped itup, and kept it with me ever since, just in case. But nothing had happened. Whenever Iput my fingers on it, I got no psychic charge. The bone was dry and cold.\u200b\u201cNope, he\u2019s still quiet,\u201d I said.Lockwood glanced at the others. \u201cWell, that was a pretty big explosion, Luce,\u201d hesaid. \u201cAll those other ghosts are gone.\u201d\u200b\u201cI know. But that\u2019s because their Sources were destroyed. Here\u2019s his Source,\u201d I said.\u201cI saved it. That explosion wouldn\u2019t destroy his spirit, would it?\u201d\u200b\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe.\u201d\u200b\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t. I\u2019m sure it wouldn\u2019t.\u201d\u200b\u201cOr disrupt his connection with it.\u201d\u200b\u201cNo. That doesn\u2019t make sense. I guess it\u2019s true he won\u2019t come back in daylight. He\u2019snot protected from the sun by the silver-glass now that he\u2019s out of the jar. But at nighttime\u2026 that\u2019s when he should come back.\u201dThat\u2019s what I kept telling myself, but I didn\u2019t actually believe my theory.

Remove those nets?\u201d\u201cThat certainly could be part of it,\u201d Lockwood said, \u201cbut that\u2019s not all.

After only amoment\u2019s hesitation, Lockwood had agreed; and curiously, when the Gate wasdismantled and the bed removed, it was discovered that the death-glow hanging over ithad entirely gone. The room was peaceful now, stripped bare of psychic tragedy, thoughstill sporting a giant circular ghost-burn on the floor, the legacy of our Gate. It had beenuniversally decided that, since we now had a spare room, Holly could officially move in.\u200b\u201cDraw me up a wish-list,\u201d Holly said. \u201cDo you really not want that room, Lucy?

There\u2019s a Screaming Spirit in a vestry; agabbling voice coming from a well, and a haunted yew tree that utters guttural remarks.There\u2019s a cowled Spectre in a shopping centre in Staines \u2013 my correspondent wasn\u2019t sureif it was a nun or a kid in a hoodie. There\u2019s a bleeding barrel, a Raw-bones on a barge\u2026\u201d\u200bShe went on telling me. Lockwood wrote lists on the cloth. George stole a pen anddid a dubious cartoon. I drank some tea and sat in the morning sunlight. The skull staredpeaceably out at nothing. I hadn\u2019t lied to Holly. I was happy with my little attic bedroom. Almost alone of all therooms in the house it had been overlooked by our enemies after our flight through theGate, and was just the same as it had always been. I often went there, in the evenings ofthose numb and quiet days, to rest and think a little under the low-slung eaves.That evening was no different. The windowsill was bathed in the last warm dregs ofsunshine. You could see rings in the dust where the ghost-jar used to sit. I put theblackened skull on the sill in its traditional place and looked down into Portland Row.The sky was grey and pink, and the sun was shining on the houses on the oppositeside, making them glittery with life. White curtains shone, and the ghost wards in theirwindows sparkled. Children were playing in the street below.There was a knock at the door. I turned and answered, and Lockwood looked in. Hehad his new long coat on, as if ready to go out, and was clutching a sheaf of papers to hischest.\u200b\u201cHi, Lucy. Sorry to disturb.\u201d\u200b\u201cThat\u2019s fine.
